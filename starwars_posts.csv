They don't need to reboot the 7-9 movies, and it's very unlikely this will ever happen. May end up being worst than before.  They made a lot of mistakes, but I do think it's salvageable with a ""George Lucas Director's Cut"" with very few basic movie changes and some deeper plot mechanics added. Here is an overview:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Dialogue in episode 9 changed to include references to Palpatine &amp; Plagueis. I would personally do this via flashback sequences, placed in movies 7-8, possibly with force visions. This is to give the viewer more of an understanding of what is going on in the overarching story. 

  
2. Mary Poppins scene, hyper speed jihad, and casino Royale scene changed in episode 8. Luke’s scenes reshot to make him awesome and not weak. Mark Hamill is a boss, he would do this in a heart beat. These would be the only reshoots needs.

3. Overall recut to make the story flow better as one cohesive unit, instead of feeling like 3 stand-alone movies with the same characters, similar to how 1-3 flow well, 4-6 flow well.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that JJ Abrams missed was the story of Darth Plagueis, because clearly he has no understanding of the extended universe and the theories created. The plot of 9 would focus on this. The story, in a gist, would be that:

1. Darth Plageuis learned how to transfer his soul to another clone or living body through the dark side of the force. It is unclear where this ability was learned, but could be explored in other movies/shows.

2. Palpatine was Darth Plageuis' apprentice. At some point in the past, Plageuism, old and likely soon to die, takes over Palpatines body, killing the original Palpatine either through the transfer or literally killing him. It is unclear how many times this transfer has happened, but at this point the viewer understands that Plageuis is operating the rule of 2 (master / padawan) to maintain his lifecycle indefinitely.  

3. Palpatine marks and rears Anakin as a vessel to the point he should be so that he has influence in the Jedi order after his soul transfer to Anakin. This idea fails when Obi Wan destroys his body at the end of episode 3. Obi Wan, having figured out Palpatine is likely Plagueis, as Plagueis would have been the ONLY SITH POWERFUL ENOUGH at this time to do what Palpatine did, hides the children so that they cannot be reared to become the next vessel.

4. Episodes 4-6 happen

5. Episode 4-8 happen. Plageuis either survives his fall, or he has short term clone bodies on hand that would allow him to live until finding new body. This part isn’t super important. The main over arching story of 7-8 would not change drastically, but Kylo's vision sequences would have discussion with Plageuis, and there would be force vision sequences revealing the above context of what is actually happening in Episodes 1-9: Plageuis is searching for immortality, and the Skywalkers get in the way of that.

6. Plageuis sets into motion the events of 7-9, and eventually meets his demise at the hand of Kilo. 

7. As an aside, this whole thing could be pretty easily turned away from ""super force user"" to simply ""Plageuis learned to transfer his consciousness into clones/manufactured bodies"". Both Anakin and Ray are manufactured simply to be Plageuis vessel. I don't think this is necessarily important to the story, but it's one way that they could a bit more easily explain the whole thing.

Not only does the moment seem to just be cheaply thrown in at the last minute - it is also a complete rejection of the major themes that the trilogy was developing up until that point.  Additionally, the “true” parentage of Rey presented in TROS presents many awkward plot holes that can’t easily be explained away.  Here I will seek to establish these points, as well as present a potential solution to these issues, one that provides a fulfilling conclusion to Rey's identity crisis and may have been lurking in the shadows since the OT...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As far as I could tell from my most recent watch, one of the major themes of the sequel trilogy was to not be afraid of who you are - rather you should embrace what defines you and use that to improve yourself and others.  We see this theme explored in what I consider to be the main protagonist and antagonist of the trilogy - Rey and Ben.  Both struggle with identity crises throughout the trilogy internally and outwardly (Ben literally wavers between two names and takes his mask on and off throughout the movies).  

Ben’s character arc begins with denial of his past and family lineage, to the point where he kills his own father and tells Rey to “kill” the past if you have to.  By the end of the trilogy, he embraces his past by acquiescing to his mother’s dying wish and uses his newfound identity to save his loved ones (quite literally when he sacrifices himself to heal Rey).  

Rey similarly experiences an identity crisis character arc - she begins without a clue of her family lineage, but suspects some grand parentage based on the uniquely strong powers she begins to discover.  In TLJ, she is told that her parentage is nothing noteworthy but she seems to take this with a grain of salt given her powers and a sense of something more. Then in TROS, she is told by Palpatine that she, in fact, is his kin and her true destiny is to replace him on the throne of the Sith.  She instead repudiates this purpose, using the power of all the Jedi to destroy Palpatine.  Then, she quite literally changes her identity at the end of the movie when she declares herself a Skywalker.

Rey changing her name completely contradicts the trilogy’s major theme and Ben’s character arc.  The message of her arc is essentially “don’t be afraid of who you are -- UNLESS you are related to the most evil person in the galaxy, then just change your name and start over”.  A much better ending to the arc would mirror the original trilogy: Luke discovers he is the son of a very evil person in Darth Vader.  He initially rejects the notion, but at the end of the trilogy he embraces it and uses his identity to turn his father to the light and save the galaxy.  In Rey’s case, I don’t think anyone believes there is any chance of her turning Palpatine to the light -- but that is not the point: Palpatine is the epitome of evil, the dark hole in her family name.  He is the darkness in her identity that she is recognizing and rejecting wholeheartedly, thus redeeming herself and further proving the great Star Wars’ theme that Luke proved in the OT: no identity is truly gone (remember when Luke himself said “No one is ever really gone”?).  Yes, Palpatine is truly gone to the dark side, but I think we would all agree that he is not a person at this point -- he is just a facet of Rey’s identity used as a plot device to show the incredibly dark potential of her true identity.  Her triumph at the end of the movie shows her recognition of this dark potential but also proves the potential for good in any identity.  When she takes the Skywalker name at the end of the movie, she completely rejects this newly redeemed identity and the major themes of the entire Star Wars series (“don’t be afraid of who you are” and “No one is ever really gone”).

Even if you do buy this end to Rey’s arc, I still would argue that it falls flat.  Let’s say that in her triumph at the end of TROS, Rey isn’t a Palpatine any longer - she becomes a standard-bearer for “all the Jedi” and uses this power to defeat the final enemy.  In this case, her true identity is simply a figurehead for the Jedi, something unprecedented in Star Wars and unsatisfying from a character perspective.  By this logic she doesn’t really have an identity, she is just a representation of many great people before her.  And then you could argue that when she gives herself the Skywalker name, she is assuming an individual identity.  But again - this feels cheap to the viewer.  The Skywalker name refers to a very important and specific subset of people in the Star Wars universe - it’s not an all inclusive term for Jedi.  Simply by changing her name in the last few minutes of a movie we have resolution for the whole trilogy? No thanks.  

But what if I told you that Rey’s assumption of the Skywalker name isn’t actually a cheap, undeserved identity change?  What if I told you that she was actually realizing and embracing her true identity all along, thereby reinforcing the theme of the trilogy and the Star Wars series as a whole?

How is this possible you ask? It’s simple: Rey is the incestuous daughter of Luke and Leia.

At the end of TROS, she is asked by a random bystander what her family name is.  Rey looks off into the distance, as if searching for an answer - knowing that something is calling to her.  There, upon the site where she just ceremonially buried their lightsabers, she sees the force ghosts of Luke and Leia smiling at her, as if beckoning her to a realization.  It is then that she comes to and declares herself a “Skywalker”.

Just minutes before during the climax of the movie, we heard essentially every major past Jedi come to Rey’s aid and voice their support for her as she rises to defeat Palpatine.  At the end of ROTJ, we see force ghosts of several important Jedi (Yoda, Obi Wan, Anakin) looking on happily at the celebration on Endor.  But in this moment with Rey, we only see Luke and Leia -- nobody else.  Anakin is also a Skywalker - why has he not come to show his appreciation?  It’s simple: because this is not just a celebration of victory, this is a specific message to Rey, which she receives and acknowledges.  She is Luke and Leia’s daughter -- not notionally as a result of her name change, but biologically through and through.

From this lens, the finality of Rey’s character arc is much more fulfilling and reinforces the trilogy’s major themes. Throughout the trilogy, she is searching for her place and along this journey she is fed false information first from Kylo (Ben) and later from Palpatine.  In spite of all this manipulation, she pushes through to find the truth, thanks in part to the support of past Jedi who may know her true identity and are supporting her along the way.  Therefore, the end of the movie isn’t a repudiation of her past self or an identity change -- it is a realization and acceptance of the truth that had been building all along and culminates in the final scene, when Luke and Leia present themselves.  The result is that Ben and Rey, two inexplicably linked characters throughout the trilogy, end arm-in-arm, each accepting their true identity as a Skywalker.

Stepping back a little bit -- It’s clear that there is something fishy going on with Luke and Leia’s relationship throughout the series.  In Empire we sense a romantic connection between them, culminating in Leia openly kissing Luke in front of Han.  Even when their sibling relationship is unveiled in ROTJ, Han is still very skeptical of their bond.  Plus, at the beginning of TFA it is revealed that Han and Leia are awkwardly estranged.  This is explained away as being a result of the fallout from their son’s turn to the dark side, but why would that cause the parents to split?  Wouldn’t Leia and Han instead be united in their grief over their son?  Yes, the separation could have to do with their disagreement on the causes of their son’s downfall -- but couldn’t some rift with Luke be somewhat to blame?  Luke has banished himself to seclusion due to his failure with Ben, but again - wouldn’t Han, Luke, and Leia be united in their grief?  Could there be some other rift lingering that is to blame?  When Rey comes to see Luke in TLJ, he is unreasonably harsh and cold to her - a side we have never seen from Luke, the most noble and honorable hero in the galaxy.  Could this be because Rey reminds him of a past love that ended horribly, shattering the bond of a once inseparable trio?  In TROS, it is revealed that Leia and Luke’s close relationship extended past ROTJ, to the point where he trained her in the Jedi arts -- what else are they hiding?

Rey’s true identity also explains another key concept of the sequel trilogy - the force dyad that we see between her and Ben.  Over the course of the trilogy, we begin to discover the ridiculously strong connection between them, to the point where they can communicate freely and pass lightsabers from a distance.  We have really never seen anything like this in the Star Wars series so it warrants some explanation.  The only other somewhat similar connection we have seen in the series is the strong bond between Luke and Leia, leading us to speculate about their relationship before it is revealed in RoTJ.  At the end of Empire when Luke is missing a hand and hanging helplessly, Leia hears him and instantly knows where he is to save him.  Yes, we have seen similar senses among other Jedi in the series, but this seems more instant, exact and close - similar to the force dyad between Rey and Ben.  How could two random people have a similar, if not stronger, connection than that of siblings Luke and Leia? Simple, they aren’t just random people - they are half siblings.

Let’s shift back to Palpatine - it should be no surprise to anyone that the most evil man in the galaxy, one who manipulated Anakin into the most powerful villain the galaxy had ever seen, would be capable of fabricating a lie to appeal to Rey, another young and incredibly powerful talent.  In ROTS, Palpatine uses the power to save loved ones from dying as the ultimate seduction to draw Anakin to the dark side.  In TROS, this same approach would not appeal to Rey because she already has discovered this power towards the beginning of the movie, the same power that Ben uses to save her at the end.  What strategy could possibly manipulate this girl? Easy -- play into the only major crisis that has been crippling her for the entire trilogy: her identity.  Countless times throughout the trilogy, we see Rey yearning for a place she belongs. She wants someone to tell her who she is and what her purpose is.  As explained earlier, this is the crux of her character arc, which gets so terribly ruined at the end of the trilogy.  Palpatine is an all-knowing master of manipulation who is merely playing into this weakness by fabricating a false backstory.  We even see this manipulation almost work towards the end of TROS, as Rey slowly approaches Palpatine and seems to be about to obey him until she realizes that Ben is coming to support her.

Also, let’s think about the implications if Rey really was a Palpatine.  The concept of Palpatine reproducing introduces an entire family tree of potentially force-sensitive, VERY powerful people with a proclivity for evil.  When and how much did Palpatine reproduce?  Where were these people in the previous two trilogies?  Does their existence potentially contradict the “Rule of Two” that existed in both of the previous trilogies?  Too many potential plot-holes to answer -- the only solution is that Rey actually isn’t a Palpatine.  She is a Skywalker.

While Disney’s sequel trilogy presents many glaring issues to the Star wars universe that this write-up doesn’t even begin to address holistically, the theory of Rey’s true parentage seems to at least rectify some of them.  Rey’s true identity as a biological Skywalker reinforces the themes of the sequel trilogy and the rest of the Star Wars trilogies.

In RotJ, Vader is still an apprentice. In Return of the Jedi, however, it vaguely alludes to the Emperor knowing something that Vader doesn't. ""Power of the dark side"" is spoken twice in Return. Vader was still an apprentice all the way till his death. 

I mean, realistically, Emperor says to Luke to take Vader's place and I'm doubtful there are trials for Sith to face like Jedi, so how does one stop being a Sith apprentice? Do what Palps did and kill Plageuis  and become the master? The rule of two. 

I know it probably seems nitpicky, but it's a glaring error said by Vader.",True,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1765766,public,spoiler,,,"""The circle is now complete.

Something that Ahsoka later internalises. Problem is, that at least in the wider context these criticisms come off as very naive and ignorant especially from someone like Ahsoka.

The criticism is that the Jedi fight the war instead of helping the ""little man"". Problem is that fighting the war itself **IS** helpign the ""little man"". The Jedi fight to save people from war, oppression, slavery and death, not some abstract idea of politics or interests.

And Ahsoka herself should know that more than anyone since she participated in all those operations

Preventing the genocide on Naboo by the blue shadow virus, saving the pacifist aliens from the CIS weapon of mass destruction, saving the Zygerian slaves. And these are just the missions she happened to be on, not counting those that other Jedi handled like the oppression on Ryloth.  
Yes, what happened to the Martez was tragic but to imply the Jedi dont care because they couldnt save 2 people just ingores literally everything else.

Furthermore it gets even weirder because even after that, what does she do ? Does she spend her time helping the average citizen like the Martez Sisters? No. She goes to war herself! She goes to Mandalore to fight. Of course her reasoning is that she wants to ""help the people"" but so did any other Jedi who fought. So when she goes to war, she actually does it for the people but when other Jedi go to war they just do it for politics ?  
And again, trying to pretend Mandalore was more urgent than Coruscant itself is dumb. Not only was Coruscant under attack, meaning thousands of innocents could be dying, Coruscant could mean the defeat of the entire Republic itself. Maul wasnt killing random Mandalorians, he wanst enacting a cull or genocide, Grievous and the CIS were killing thousands b the minute.

That part and Ahsoka's stance felt contived and kinda OOC and if the writers wanted us to side with her it was even more contrived and irrational.

Just finished the prequels

Episode 1 - a really good base, tells you what you need to know about the franchise. Absolutely love QGJ. I can already tell he’s the smartest of the bunch. Shame he dies would’ve liked to see him more. 

Episode 2 - my least favourite. A good sequel sort of it capitalises on episode 1 but makes a lot of stuff up as it goes along. Padme changes her romantic views on anakin so quickly for no reason. So many secret armies. Count Dooku just screams Space Saruman, he had a good idea I was confused if he knew that sidious was a sith and was genuinely trying to save the republic by rebuilding it or just trying to create a rebel group.

Episode 3 - my favourite, absolutely love it. Makes my top 10 maybe 5 movies of all time. Only problem is it’s very fast paced, but I love all the ideas. Anakins fall from grace cause of his love for padme. Finally showing the consequences of the Jedi council being so so incompetent. Mace windu great lightsaber dueller horrendous person 0 social interaction. Even worse W Yoda. 800yrs of experience and you don’t realise that telling the Jedi who has the mental capacity of a 5yr old to let go of everything isn’t the best idea? OWK and Anakin’s arc carries this film though. Absolutely loved their final battle. Very very nicely done. But how the hell does anakin survive and padme dies? Surely there’s a better explanation then ‘a broken heart’????

The first song is Ashoka leaves. . So in the beginning of the song you can say it’s her realizing she doesn’t fit the Jedi order she has to leave her friend. Then towards the end a drum hits around 1:48 and boom here comes in flute (some wood wind instrument) when she tells Anakin she knows he wants to leave the order and why. The music gets louder and they finally separate and don’t see each until the last season of the clone wars but the entire time they are still distant on Ashokas side she wants to fight for mandolore and save them but Anakin want to continue other war efforts and go deal with the invasions courisount. Also her and his ideals on the order at that time are similar in the way they feel they don’t belong. But in the a difference where Ashoka is doing it because she’s lost her trust in them and Anakin believes they are weak. So boom stuff happens and Ashoka gets wrapped in order 66 her Rex and maul crash a ship and lots of clones die. While there dealing with the bodies the song burrowing the dead plays. Which has trippy sound to it and is one I think used to represent a new change of life. Meaning the musics changed because the worlds changed. This plays in a scene with Rex and Ashoka dealing with bodies. And a scene where darth Vader arrives and sees the aftermath of the crash. The two play and totally different times and totally different setting. So the song represents a full different idea because it has nothing from the original song that’s signified them drifting. Then later in rebels when darth Vader and Ashoka finally face off the song Anakin And Ashoka plays. The first 30 seconds is like an Vader imperialistic sound. That’s then moves into a creepy fade into the same wood winds that played in Ashoka leaves plays when she realizes that Vader is Anakin and she realizes that after everything she has to try to go back and feel the same emotions she felt when she first left and said she won’t leave him like before. The score then stays the same fore a second while Anakin first speaks then immediately shifts to a fight score like he almost considered joining her. Sorry if this didn’t makes sense. I rambled but I thought it was cool how her songs have much deeper meaning.

Obi-Wan saw the dutchess die right infront of him and it was brutal. It got me thinking though, out of all the Star Wars characters, does Obi-Wan have the most tragic backstory? I mean aside from the dutchess, he also watched his master Qui-Gonn die at the hands of Maul. Then there’s obviously Palpatine, who was tricking Obi-Wan the entire time, as he turned out to be a Sith Lord and helped bring about the galactic empire. From this, he lost everyone he had been working with for all those years, including the clones, the Jedi council, and most importantly, his pandawan Anakin. Looking back on it and putting myself in Obi-Wan’s position, it’s horribly sad knowing all the time he spent with Anakin was for nothing as he turned into Darth Vader. He was forced to fight the one he was supposed to train to be good and even admitted while fighting him that he failed him. Watching clone wars really makes the ending of ROTS that much more emotional too.

Instead, Maul was being much too vague, and that’s why he ended up not convincing Ahsoka. 

However, Ahsoka is also given a case of stupid during this, because she knows that Anakin was shown the future during the Mortis Arc and the vision showed him turning to the Dark Side.

According to a youtube video George Lucas explains the force is this binding field of energy that connects all life in the galaxy with each other. The light side represents the force's good side that keeps everything in balance and it is strong when people use the force for selfless reasons, while the dark side of the force represents its' subversive side that whacks everything out of balance and it gains strength when people use the force for selfish reasons. 

That being said I stumbled upon a tv tropes page that states that the light side and dark side are more than just selflessness vs selfishness. According to the site George Lucas and several other sources stated that the light side embodies concepts like love, romance, friendship, and peaceful ambitions, while the dark side embodies hatred, lust, competition, and violence. 

And this is where I am confused. Now I can understand why the dark side of the force aka the force's selfish side would embody negative concepts like hatred, lust, and violence, but what I don't understand is how the light side of the force, it selfless side, can embody concepts like love, friendship, and ambition. The reason why is because these concepts seem to fall more under the selfish column rather than selfless column and since the light side is suppose to embody the force's selfless nature how can it also embody concepts that run contradictory to its nature.

Could someone please help me understand why Lucas thought that pursuing things like love, friendship, and romance don't contradict his view of the light side?

A good example of this was an exchange I saw on twitter recently. A guy tweeted his review of The Force Awakens since he had rewatched it. He said that he loved Rey in the first 2 acts, but the final act seemed like they handed her character a ton of abilities with little to no explanation. In a separate tweet in the thread he said that he was not a fan of Rey defeating Kylo Ren given that Kylo had received training from Luke and Snoke. Although not done with his trainin, he felt Kylo should have defeated her with ease. He went on to rate the film a 6/10.

The replies and quote tweets were filled with sequel fans referring to him as ""sexist"" and quoting him with ""just say you hate women"".

This is because the Force as a narrative device has been left intentionally vague in terms of rules and definitions, so as to allow the writers to avoid writing themselves into a corner. 

And so I have decided to compile that list myself, beginning with the rules laid out in the OT. If this proves interesting enough to myself and others, I’ll move on to the PT. 

(If others would like to compile a list of space travel rules presented in the OT/PT, please feel free to do so.)

I am starting with the OT as this is the de facto *source*. This is where it all comes from; it is the primary rule book. 

What follows is a list of rules laid out in *Star Wars* (1977), followed by excerpts from the script that provide context and reference for these rules. These excerpts represent all references to the Force I could find in the script. If I have missed any, please let me know. 

I am working from the assumption that “rules” laid out in these films represent an additive definition of what the Force itself is. That is, unless it is specifically stated in the text, these rules do not create exclusions (that things *must* happen such and such a way). They instead create possibilities for the Force as a narrative device. As I have found below, the original film at least does not, in fact, offer any exclusions in its rules. 

I will follow up with rules from *Empire Strikes Back* and *Return of the Jedi* when I can.

LUKE

father.

(9)Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice. 

BEN
You don't need to see his identification.
                            TROOPER
We don't need to see his identification.

BEN
These are not the droids your looking for.

LUKE

BEN
Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
…

LUKE
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

HAN
Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
…

BEN
This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.

LUKE
(laughing) With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight?

BEN
Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. … Stretch out with your feelings.

… …

BEN
The Force will be with you... always!
… …

VADER
(13)A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

TARKIN
Surely he must be dead by now.

VADER
Don't underestimate the power of the Force.

TARKIN
The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.

VADER
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

BEN
Only a master of evil, Darth.

VADER
Your powers are weak, old man.

BEN
You can't win, Darth. (17)If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.

Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. (18)Ben's cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it. Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the empty cloak.

DODONNA
Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!

However, purely for the sake of discussion, here are a few statements of his that I disagree with personally, in my headcanon-

Statement: Windu beat Palpatine fair and square

Opinion: In the beginning of the fight Palpatine is pushing windu back and even had his lightsaber pointed to windu's chest, but later on windu gains the upper hand, especially after  the window breaks, this can be interpreted as Palpatine sensing Anakin and preparing the situation to show Anakin that the Jedi would kill an unarmed man, or that Windu began to use Sidious' dark energy against him with Vaapad.

I think saying that Windu won fair and square takes away a layer of complexity to the scene and makes it very cut and dried, It always seemed to me watching the film and reading the novelisation that it was implied that Palpatine withdrew his assault when he sensed Anakin approaching. What do you guys think?

Statement: Luke has equal potential to Anakin

Opinion: This always kinda grated with me, I always saw Luke as an ordinary person, who was the child of someone special. Having him be the strongest makes him less interesting and takes away from his relatability.

In the EU, Luke is probably the most powerful force user of all time and does reach his potential, unlike Anakin, but in the movies he's enormously powerful, but hasn't been shown enough to consider him the most powerful force user, despite having ample time to reach his potential post ROTJ.

I had no idea how much disdain the community had for episodes I-III, compared to IV-VI.

So I decided to educate myself as to why these episodes are so bad compared to IV-VI, and thought I would share my opinions to start a conversation around this topic. Maybe a sort of debate if we will ?

From what I understand. The general sentiment is this. 

Also. Sorry for any layout problems, I'm procrastinating studying and am on mobile. 

Why IV-VI are superior:

- The lightsaber battles of IV-VI are more realistic. Having been choreographed by expert swordsmen compared to the more theatrical dancing style of the prequels. Also master swordsmen tend to take a much more conservative approach when facing off, I haven't had to face off with a master swordsman yet so I can't confirm or deny that fact, but the experts say this is the way. (shameless mando plug)
- The sequel series were defined by their attention to detail, costume design, and are thus heralded for holding up so well almost 40 years later. 
- The characters had more substance.
- They were not ruined by CGI. 
- The plot has more substance with a solid premise hinging on good vs evil, with some decent plot twists tucked in for good measure. (Luke and Leia, am I right ? ;) ) 
- The lack of low-key political statements. 
- They don't have JarJar 

Why the prequels suck:

- The lightsaber battles look like circus acts with dancers waving glowy sticks around
- The CGI was tacky and excessive
- The Plot is shocking 
- The characters are shallow
- It's pathetic that the story starts with a trade dispute 
- There are so many political statements being made by featuring the Senate and the jedi counsel. 

But, I am currently rewatching the prequels to see if I can spot these glaringly experience ruining issues. 

I'm sorry but I have to say. I still think the prequels are awesome. 

- Nothing was cooler than watching TPM. Maul vs two knights fight it out all cool. Then running into the yard to recreate the scene with your siblings or whoever else was willing to pick up a broom. To this day I still get giddy thinking of how cool they look, and how cool I'd look if I could do a flying pirouette to block two strikes whilst kicking my assailant in the chest all whilst I flick something inconveniencing me away with the force,  but I digress. 
- Ewan Mcgregor, Liam Neeson, and Hayden Christensen do a great job of portraying the jedi at their prime 
-The CGI holds up so well. IMO it looks better than a lot of the marvel movies that are a bunch of actors in a green box, with CGI filling in the rest. 
- I'm sorry, but honestly, the trade federation and their dispute was a ploy by Sidius to kick off the rebellion and start a takeover of the senate. It is mundane because it is cunning I see where georgie-boy was coming from kicking things off that way, I don't spend tons of time thinking of what-ifs but, what else could he have chosen as a plot that wouldn't be stupidly far fetched ? 
-JAR JAR still sucks, but he isn't so shocking that you can use him as a get out of jail free card in your prequels suck argument. 

And that's me, I'm still loving these series, and I'm loving that this community and this universe exists 40 years later. I hope somebody gets to read and engage ! One thing we can all agree on: The universe is awesome, the disney sequels are very..... Different, and we all love a good jedi vs sith battle.

I’ve got a few personal choices, and would like to know yours too. The pantheon of known ships that he could potentially choose from is vast, and while he’s just as likely to have a brand new ship design for his next ride, if Favreau and Filoni wanted to use an existing one, what would he have?

My personal favourite for Mando would be a Lancer-class pursuit ship, seen as the Shadow Caster in Rebels (a Filoni creation, so he’d be familiar with it). A sleek, one-man transport with a fair armament and space for his bounties, it’s a bit bigger than the Razor Crest, allowing him to share adventures with more guests of the week without it getting TOO cozy for him. 

What with the show apparently tending towards larger things, he may take up a spare Kom’rk type ship that Bo Katan oft used, given she had one handy in Mando S2. Would he be comfy in something as big as a YT transport? Not likely. But who knows, Din isn’t exactly rolling on credits, and beggars can’t be choosers...

Ever since SWTOR people have been begging for a KOTOR III and every year is *the year* except this time their seems to be more substance to this vapor ware. But even still what form it will take is a huge question.

For example is a KOTOR game a KOTOR game if its not about Revan, the exile, and the first jedi purge and Jedi civil war? Well the KOTOR game wasn't even the first to be called KOTOR, that goes to the second arc of the Tales of the Jedi comics from which the game got its name. and even the KOTOR comic only uses the Mandalorian wars as a backdrop to a story about a hidden cult of jedi and then a ring of intergalatic slavers. 

And while to some the Old Republic may be synonymous with the KOTOR games that era spans about seven thousand years and (cutting off after 7000bby because that's when the fallen jedi were kicked out and formed the sith) dozens of different eras and wars. SWTOR is set 300 some years after the game and is still a OR era game. 

Now their is some good news in that most of the places and events still exist and exist in the right time frame. The Great Hyperspace War, Great Sith War, Great Galatic War (SWTOR's war), and Jedi-Sith wars all exist at the same time period. Plus Revan along with many jedi and sith from the TOTJ comics and other books also exist along with the gravity superweapon that blew up malachor.  Even the First Jedi purge and Mandalorian Wars exist in the NEU though we don't know when they took place yet. 

So the timeline is intact and the characters are there but that causes a problem. Is this just going to be a remake? If its done like the FF7 remake that could be amazing. Keep it close enough to the OG to be the same general story but change some things to make it kind of interesting. Heck they could move it to the start of the New Sith Wars to help explain why they are still using the hammer head corvettes during the time of the GCW and New Republic.

But a lot of weight comes with that. I don't just mean them giving a canon Revan appearance, they would most likely refer to them in the third person in official texts like they do for SWTOR characters. I mean what it brings in to the Canon. When KOTOR came out we had already had the TOTJ comics and a bunch of short stories, the games were building on what was already there. But this new game is coming in when the galaxy is much much less built up. 

From the looks of things it does seem like the powers that be or at least Pablo are wanting to drag TOTJ and most of the jedi-sith lore over wholesale. And while disappointing in the Mandalorian Tython isn't the only reference to the SWTOR games or Dawn of the Jedi that we have. And we have both Lehon mentioned and the in universe ""legend of lehon""

So it would be a great chance to bring more stuff over or set in stone what has already been referenced in things like visual dictionaries. But also if it diverged to much from what the OG KOTOR games were I see people being upset. 

I just say this as a way to say I have no idea what we are going to get. I'm sure I like it but I'm in no way expecting a updated version of the game we already had before. Their are some leaks about the company and team that may be working on it and who have done lots of ports of previous games which means it could but be but I don't think its going to be the game, plot, or character people played as on their Xbox (or PC in my case)",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1762119,public,self,,,The difficulties of making a Canon KOTOR game.,0,[],0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/l6ko3g/the_difficulties_of_making_a_canon_kotor_game/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'd figured I would like to get this sub's opinions on this idea, if possible.**

 

""Okay but let’s suppose, for a moment, that the Force *is* actually malevolent.

That would make a lot of sense.

Consider, for a moment, an eldritch parasite. This ancient being feeds off of the life-force of other creatures. Not that unusual, as most living things also consume other living things, to various degrees. But this one is technically somewhat removed from the usual structures of biology. It is a passive and opportunistic predator, for the most part. Whenever a living being that is connected to it - however weakly - dies, it consumes part of its energy, and gets bigger.

As life in the galaxy flourishes, and time passes, this singular entity gets bigger, and bigger, and bigger. Like a catfish; the only limit to its growth is how much it can consume to fuel it. The larger it gets, the more it is able to sink its invisible claws into other living beings, until eventually there is hardly any life out there which hasn’t been ‘infected’ by it, and slated to become its spiritual dinner as soon as its biological form gives out.

And here we actually come to - of all things - the midichlorians. Which, the Jedi use to measure someone’s sensitivity to the Force, which works because midichlorians are the vehicle for the predatory parasite to infest living beings. The immune systems in some people begin to develop a certain degree of resistance to them, which is why some folks have more, and some have less, and this directly correlates to their Force sensitivity. The more midichlorians you have, the worse your immune system is at fending off the parasite.

The Force counters the risk of being bred out of subsequent generations by developing camouflage, and adapting itself into a more seemingly-symbiotic relationship with its prey.

What the Jedi see as the ‘light side’ of the Force, is a reflective layer that this predator has created via its connection to all living things. This network is the honey trap that encourages the beings still strongly connected to it, to spread that connection, because it affords them advantages while they are still alive. But its elements are comprised mostly of echoes and reflections of their fellow prey organisms. Force Ghosts that resemble the departed. Emotions that are transmitted along this layer and between individuals. Small amounts of power that can be siphoned off to impact the environment, and can also spread the Force to whatever living thing it comes into contact with.

This being is *huge* now, it needs a lot of juice in order to maintain its existence, let along continue to grow. And like most predators it’s willing to expend a certain amount of energy in order to guarantee a bigger pay-off.

The deeper you go into the Force, the more the Force starts exerting its own will through you. And the less you see of the reflected camouflage of it, and the more apparent it becomes that the Force wants large swaths of death to feed it. Which is why Dark Siders often become so preoccupied with things like Death Stars.

But it’s a balancing act. A large population of relatively peaceful Force sensitives, like the Jedi, cost more than they’re worth, because beyond a point they take too much energy from the Force and don’t kill enough people to pay for it. A single individual abusing their powers for self-gain and murdering left and right, though, accomplishes the goal of *feeding it.* The Force obviously doesn’t want its food supply to die out completely, but this explains the persistent cycles of the Star Wars universe - as a soon as a group of peaceful Force users becomes prominent, they get wiped out by a few Dark Siders who have tread too deeply past the reflective surface of the Force, and become actual vessels for its will.

And then when the Dark Siders have finished killing a whole bunch of people, it’s time for them to go, too, so that they don’t wipe out the entire populace and kill off the Force’s food supply beyond its ability to reasonably recover. The peaceful types then see an upswing, as they are more adept at spreading the Force. So the cycle goes - Jedi spread the Force, Sith kill the Jedi and feed the Force, Jedi kill the Sith and resume spreading the Force. It’s a planting and harvest cycle, and the galaxy is populated with the Force’s living spirit crops. Anakin Skywalker, who was arguably one of the beings most closely connected to the Force, and had an extremely high midichlorian count, basically lived this cycle in its entirety as an individual - he spread the Force as a Jedi, he killed people as a Sith, and then he ended it all in order to preserve his progeny for the next round.

tl;dr - the Force wants to eat your soul. The reason the ‘light side’ types always get so up in their own asses is because what they perceive as the Force is basically their own reflections dangling in front of them like an angler fish’s lure. The reason the ‘dark side’ types get so messed up is because they’re basically the equivalent of [those grasshoppers who get infected with a parasite that makes them drown themselves](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSpinochordodes_tellinii&amp;t=MjI4MWY4NTY5YWRhNTQyNzkzMjNkOWMwODUxYzc4ZjE4MDgxZTJhZSwwdlptNTFyQw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ARFyDmNmQkaY_AqxspeyF2w&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ffeynites.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F155460891459%2Fjasjuliet-respainey-jollysunflora&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1611784181).""

All I want to do is kill rebel scum. I’m damn good at it too, over 200 infantry and 50 X-wings decommissioned, no one can handle Betsy and I. My skills did not go unnoticed. That is why the latest Darth, supreme commander, whatever put me in Squad 42. Our squad was the answer to everything. You wanted a rebel base destroyed, done. Civilian rebellions, not on our watch. Our reputation was quickly spread across the galaxies. Four simple words, if you are lucky enough to hear them, run. 

“Stand by for Tietanfall”. See airborne my Betsy looked like your average Tie-Fighter, but she is not useless grounded. Squad 42’s Tie fighters are also Tietans. One push of a button and our ships become mechs. Standing as tall as a AT-ST and able to easily throw one around, there is nothing our Tietans can’t take on. Each of our squad choose our Tietans weapons. While the others like their Ion cannons and Energy beam rifles that can drop an X-Wing in one hit I like to get up close and personal. I equipped Betsy with a Dual Headed Contained Energy Axe, I call him Hal.

Our mission today is to eliminate the Resistance on Ajan Kloss. Just us five of Squad 42 are being sent.   
 “Jack are you ready?” “Yes Captain, systems are a go, prepared to drop.” “If we succeed today, the Rebels will think twice before defying the Empire, again. Squad 42 drop in 3…2…1.” By the time we reached the upper atmosphere the Rebels had sent out their X-wing force. “Captain I count 20, were outnumbered five to one. “That’s what it looks like.” Captain replied. “Let’s squash their confidence. Jack, What’s your bet?” “Nine, sir, I’m going for a personal best.”

The Rebels disappointed me, before they could break off formation, I charged them from their left flank. At full speed it looked like I was going to kamikaze directly into the first x-wing in my way. At the last second the repel pilot was shitting in his pants, and I was grinin ear to ear. “Tietan engaged.” Betsy shifted from ship to mech with a front roll. Axe in hand I was able to slice into three of them before they broke formation. “Wings engaged.” That move only works once. They won’t fly close enough to each other again.

Captain had already cleared four. The rest of the squad one each. Five minutes later and the X-wings were no more. “I was at eight, Captain you stole that last kill.” “Be faster next time.” Captain was the only one better than me. “Drop point is directly in enemy territory, they know were coming now.” Called the Captain. “Stand by for Tietanfall.” “Oh, Betsy I just love hearing those words.” 5…4…3…2…1. We landed directly on their AT-STs. “Oops, surprise!” Blaster fire came in from all directions. They were using the trees as cover. That didn’t matter to me I had the right tool, “Call me Lumberjack.” Hal quickly cleared the first 100 meters. Screams came from all directions as the trees took down and fell on their forces. “Come-on! Give me a challenge please!” 

“Squad we’re one kilometer away from their headquarters.” I wish they put up more of a fight but our mission lasted less than two hours. When we got to their base Ion vaporized it with his energy core. Combat these days is feeling like squishing bugs. I’m bored, so I left a message on Ajan Koss. Maybe one day I’ll get the titan brawl I crave.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1761626,public,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Ta12i1tXqoG3c5B6m9EEjbIHyqlzcM8RnvqugLCqSXM.jpg,140.0,140.0,Jake Parker's Fanart Inspired me to write a short story,0,[],0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/l6dwdi/jake_parkers_fanart_inspired_me_to_write_a_short/,,all_ads,6,,,"{'victvb66rxd61': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'victvb66rxd61', 'm': 'image/jpg', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/victvb66rxd61.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd9c3d1920ea96dcc68ef8d2eb94e3fe6fd9993f', 'x': 108, 'y': 135}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/victvb66rxd61.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5a750bbf181ee59f5c26605bd8d143bc4a53a08', 'x': 216, 'y': 270}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/victvb66rxd61.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01e7f8d5b01d71cb123b0cc29cae2b213409fe83', 'x': 320, 'y': 400}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/victvb66rxd61.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1ef81ebbc35edcb50d1441adbc6ec98248b39a8', 'x': 640, 'y': 800}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/victvb66rxd61.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=681e02448666b7f28e9c6ac830dd8b7418036e3e', 'x': 640, 'y': 800}, 'status': 'valid'}}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both can access mystical powers and are taken away to be trained. Both are presented as they grow up as being a little unhinged, but the difference is in their portrayal. Child Tom Riddle is shown at various times as looking very creepy and dangerous. Almost horror movie-esque. We're told Anakin is full of fear (and that it leads to hate) by the council but not really shown it, at least in TPM. Tom has incidents where he's unknowingly used magic in anger on fellow children at the orphanage. There's a deleted scene in TPM where Anakin gets in a fight with his friend who's apparently a young Greedo. I think it would of been a great scene if instead he angers Anakin, who unintentionally force pushes him, with Qui-Gon as a witness.

Now as the characters age, Tom Riddle is portrayed as extremely charismatic and classically handsome. I actually love Hayden Christensen as Anakin, but I think instead of being an awkward somewhat-angsty teen, being extremely charismatic and using it to get away with questionable behaviour that's leading him closer to the dark side. It be more believable of Padme falling for him, too. I think the Clone Wars TV Show actually to this approach on many occasions.

Now, I know what you're saying this is how George directed the movies to be. And that's most likely the case. He wanted Anakin to seem pure so his fall to the Dark Side is more tragic. However, it's just my opinion on this matter, there was potential to make his turn more gradual and believable.

This all came to a head with the invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation and the Republic's refusal to respond. Several Outer Rim systems realized that they could not depend on the Republic for protection and economic enfranchisement and seceded to the Confederacy.

In that downright pathetic and pitiful state he could still command enough power in the force to match 80% of Darth Sidious , the canonically stated MOST POWERFUL SITH OF ALL TIME. And Sidious had decades ahead of him in training and experience too. 

Think about it, everything Vader became and achieved - best pilot in the galaxy, greatest and most fearsome duelist in the galaxy, most prolific Jedi killer of all time, a leader/single-handed destroyer of entire armies - and he was just a stump with anger issues and a desperate need for family counseling inside that armour (the design of which intentionally further limited his abilities btw).

Howdy folks!  This is my first post here.  I decided to take a crack at writing something in a YA mode using Star Wars conventions and overarching setting.  Looking for general impressions and concrit for the first two chapters.  This is not set in the main universe, and does not tie in with major characters.  Just a little playing around in a sandbox, really.

When judges consider the merit of gymnast's floor routine, or an Olympic diver's performance, they take into account the degree of difficulty. In a similar way, I think that we should consider that TROS had no small level of difficulty to overcome in order to complete the trilogy effectively. Most jarringly, the premature death of Carrie Fisher, who was to be the OT actor in the center of this film, as Ford was in 7 and Hamill was in 8. But it also had to tie together multiple plot strings that were left a bit unkempt due to the multiple director plan forced upon them by the production schedule demanded by Disney.

I put a lot of effort into the last essay on TLJ, and I am going to try to streamline this one a bit. (I want to finish it before the semester begins on Wednesday!) It will just be this initial preamble, followed by some good/bad/neutral thoughts, and that's it. Please help fill things out below. I'm sure I missed a lot. 

Big picture, I'd like to underscore that one kind of dumb thing that we humans do, which is exasperated by social media, is to unnecessarily turn things into either/or situations where we think we have to take a side, and then we filter everything through our partisan lens. So with the sequels, people think you have to either like JJ's work or RJ's. Or for that matter, you either like the sequels or hate them. It's not necessary to do this stuff, and that's not how I am going to approach this.

In my opinion, JJ did a lot of small things right, that he deserves credit for, despite other ways the film might be uneven. 

Good:

* Luke and Rey on Ahch-to. Finally, Luke actually and directly ""hands Excalibur on to the next generation."" The act of handing Rey her saber and calling upon her to face the reality that the life of a Jedi is confronting fear was the sort of mentorship sorely lacking by Luke in TLJ. It was a great scene. I would have loved more Luke in ROTS, but this was well done (besides his hair, WTF was that?)
* Having Leia train Rey, so that the line of transmission is Luke-Leia-Rey. We got to see that Leia is in fact, very close to being a Jedi, and only not so for technical reasons. It was clever, and gave us a Leia in line with the best of the EU. It was also a good way to see that *both* Skywalkers bring up the next generation. The training montage gave us another chance during training to see that while Rey is a bit of force prodigy, her main mistakes are mental.
* Showing that the entire race to save the galaxy builds upon Luke's years of recovering the Jedi teachings and hunting down the Sith. This helps (a little) with some of the issues with TLJ. 
* Lando. Lando makes everything better. And it's refreshing to have an OT hero not die just die (this one was low-effort, but I do mean it).
* Poe and Finn's interactions when becoming generals was funny in a star wars way. By that I mean a way that makes us enjoy the comedy while also feeling that it fit the characters, *our* characters. They earned this joke, because in their own ways, Finn and Poe both grew into the mantle of leadership despite themselves.  We needed more of this overall in the trilogy, but moments like this were well done.
* The force dyad idea. George Lucas said that in each movie, there were new planets, new instances of the use of the force, and new creatures. While a lot of the sequels have derivative ideas, this was a very clever, interesting notion, the seeds of which are in TFA's mind-probe scene, and developed further in the bond seen TLJ. Kylo and Rey are mortal enemies, and yet, understand each other in ways nobody else can. It was a new and interesting take on the issues of love, loyalty, and conflict in SW. It also gives us a way to see why Rey is so powerful without training. And for people who don't like it, think of it as something like the force bond of Revan and Bastilla. 
* Not going ""grey jedi"". The Grey Jedi idea is a mistake. Lucas has said that the dark side is cancer. So balance isn't a little health and a little cancer. The Jedi seek balance. Duel of the Fates would have messed up the lore of the force, and JJ's story here respects it.
* Threepio's moment of bravery. This scene was epic and beautiful. The emblem of cowardliness is willing to basically get a lobotomy to help his friends defeat evil. Great moment, and as always, Tony Daniels crushed it. 

Neutral (or I just can't decide whether it's bad or good, but it has to be one of the two):

* Palps. I don't know what to say about this one. I always thought that resurrecting Palps was one of the weakest things from the EU, like what you do when you run out of ideas, and that's the one that they used here. I also didn't like the way it seemed to diminish Anakin's act in RoTJ. That said, thinking about it a bit more, it entirely fits the character of Sidious to be completely obsessed with   with overcoming death.  After seeing that Plagueis' attempt to achieve physical immortality failed, as a master Sith alchemist, Palps would avail himself of arcane practices like essence binding and the like. It's completely consistent with the character and his own story. Does it undermine Anakin's status as the Chosen One? Not necessarily. Anakin broke the hold of the sith on the galaxy, which healed the ""wound"" in the force effected by Palps and Plaugeis. If one understands that Anakin, along with his children and grandchildren, are the ones to vanquish Palpatine (which is how GL talked about it, minus the grandchildren), it fits fine.  
* Rose. To repeat something from my post on TLJ, why has so much ink been spilled on Rose? Guys, we didn't worry that much about Lobot's actor being highlighted too much/not enough. Here, she is basically Leia's trusted aid, no longer just an anonymous engineer and she has a key role in the final attack scene. Good for her. We didn't have endless debates about whether Wedge got enough airtime or too much. Can we move on?
* Rey Palatine. I loved the nobody angle, and this seems unnecessary. The dyad was enough to help understand why she was such a prodigy. But whatever. It still gives us a way to see that Rey must confront powerful darkness. This was, of course, already done, with a certain guy named Luke Skywalker and another guy named Vader, so whatevs. 

Bad

* As others have mentioned ad nauseum, it packs too much into too little time. I would guess that it was due to pressure from above, but if 20 extra minutes could have been kept in, it would feel less like a sprint. RotJ had many calm moments, as did RoTS, both of which had a lot to carry together to finish a trilogy on their own terms.
* Too many new, but unnecessary characters. When you remember the OT, besides the big 4 and Chewie, on one side, and Vader and Palpatine on the other, there weren't that many characters with much airtime. Why JJ would introduce even more in this episode, when the established characters are already fighting for air, seems like a waste. Rose could have had the part of the hobbit guy. 
* JJ's way of framing everything as ""urgent!!!"" and ""extreme!!!"" can be toned down. The Exegol fleet need not each be equipped with planet killers, nor need it be so cartoonishly large, for it to still be a threat.
* Not having [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iELUFjl16-U&amp;ab_channel=jonh) be the final fight scene is such a lost opportunity that it boggles the mind that JJ didn't think of it. It would truly cap off ""The Skywalker Saga"" and give all of the core heroes their due (adding Leia--she should be there as well), while also giving Rey her status as their conduit.
* Missed opportunities to tie in to the earlier films and make them feel more coherent. Zorri Bliss could have mentioned to Poe ""stories about the unkillable jedi who stood down the First Order on Crait."" Finn could have had more of a role as an ex-Stormtrooper who was recruiting others to join the resistance. And so on.

They were also wrong about love and attachments. Since both Ben and Anakin were bought back because of their love for another person. 

However, there seems to be this tendency to assume that because Kenobi is a hero he is always right, and everything he does and believes is correct. This extends as far as either ignoring or excusing his negative traits and questionable actions.

What if the Sequels were about Luke? I mean the 9 movies are called ""The Skywalker Saga"" so why not have it be about Skywalkers we know and love and not some random chick?

It got me thinking what IF, Luke was the protagonist and not Rey.
Palpatine returns and Luke finds out, so now as an old man and the last of the Jedi he must return and defeat Palpatine. He failed the first time as a young man and his father died because of it, now Sidious is back and Luke feels like Anakin died for nothing. We follow him across 2 movies where he tries to get back to his old ways, connect to the force and prepare for the grand showdown. He tracks down Ahsoka, Ezra and the rest and they make up his team instead of it being Ray, Finn, Poe and others.

Final showdown happens, they duel for a long time and Luke manages to beat Palpatine in Lightsaber combat but Palpatine tricks him and manages to get him with force lightning, Luke tries defending with his lightsaber but Palps is too powerful, the Kyber crystal explodes and Lukes robo arm melts away from the blast. Luke is hurt and burned from the blast, he lays on the ground nearly dead, palps gives his grand speech, as palps is doing that
Plo Koon as a force ghost speaks to Luke, imparting him with his knowledge. Palps screams his ""I am ALL the Sith"" line and shoots force lightning at Luke, Luke in that moment returns with Force Judgement. Palps is shocked for a moment but continues.

Luke is on his knees as they fight eachother using the force only, they both struggle against eachother. Luke is finally overpowered as Palpatine stands over him ready to finish him off, he shoots lightning one last time at him and at that moment it just stops mid way and does not reach Luke, slowly the Jedi force ghosts appear. Yoda, Obi Wan, Mace, Plo Koon, Qui Gon, Kit Fisto... their arms outstretched pushing him back. Palpatine is really struggling now as are the Jedi and in that moment, Vaders image flashes infront of Palpatine. Palpatine is scared. Vaders armor crumbles and from the pieces walks out Anakin surrounded by a blue glow signifying the force and his place as the chosen one, he outstretches his arm and palps lightning begins destroying him, than Luke flies through the air and cuts through Palpatine. 

Something like that anyways.
How would you guys have liked that compared to what we got?

The Jedi get purged or nearly wiped out, they rebuild, it happens again, rinse, repeat. After watching TROS I just felt myself hoping for something different and for that reason I hope there is no formal Jedi Order in the post Skywalker Saga Era. 

Don't get me wrong, I still want light side force users, and if you want to call them Jedi go ahead, but I don't think they should have any kind of real structure. The Jedi's rules and dogma have doomed them time and again. The cycle needs to be broken.

So what would I prefer? That any force sensitives be able to seek out ""Master Rey Skywalker"" or another Jedi to train them, and that when their training is complete they can go on their way, live their lives, and do as they please. You'd have a new generation of force users finding their own paths, learning the ways of the light side of the force and hopefully spreading some good. If they wanted to start a family they could, if they want to become bounty hunters, why not? No order to get bogged down in meetings and debates just people learning to master their abilities and use them as they see fit.

Would it be perfect? Of course not. I'm sure some would go down a dark path, some may choose to abandon their abilities, some may seek to establish their own order and gain control. And that's where the conflict can come in. Individual force users having to band together to protect the galaxy, all with their own ideas of what that means.

There's been a growing interest in Clone Wars related content for the last few years which excites me because it's probably my favorite era. 

During the Clone Wars, the Republic and Separatists were relatively on even footing, you had the Hutt Cartels and other crime organizations in the middle, you had the Night Sisters on Dathomir and the Mandalorians who were split on pacifism or their warrior heritage. The Jedi were at their full strength and while technically only two Sith, you had multiple Dark side users running around such as Savage, Maul, Asajj, and turned Jedi such as Pong Krell and Bariss. Now keep in mind the game would have to sacrifice lore accuracy for gameplay reasons.

Real quick, in case you don't want to be spoiled on, spoilers for the following

Season 2 of The Mandalorian

*Thrawn*

*Thrawn: Alliances*

*Thrawn: Treason*

Star Wars Rebels

Now thats out of the way, into the theory:

So, we know Grand Admiral Thrawn is till alive, and we assume that Ezra is still alive. We also know the Magistrate (from the Ashoka episode) knows where Thrawn is, or at least has some connections to him. However, a very interesting dynamic is introduced into this period, pre First Order, where we have Thrawn still in play, and Ezra, but also (as revealed in *Thrawn: Treason*) The Chiss Ascendancy, along with Eli Vanto (Thrawns assistant in *Thrawn*), and Director Krennics Assistant Director Ronan (From *Thrawn: Treason*), and the Grysk Hegemony, lurking in the Unknown Regions.

Before I go deeper, I'm going to give a bit of background on the Chiss Ascendancy and Grysk Hegemony.

Grand Admiral Thrawn is a member of the Chiss Ascendancy. He faked being exiled from his people for launching a Preemptive strike to gain access into the Empire, and he joined the Imperial Navy and rose to the rank of Grand Admiral in *Thrawn* (a very good book I would recommend to any Star Wars fan). The rest of the Chiss, however, live somewhere in the Unknown Regions. Much (at least in canon) isn't know about them, but they do use force sensitive children to help navigate through uncharted space, these are known as Skywalkers, they also are naturally intelligent (or at least most of the ones in the books are), and use a weird naming system (for instance Grand Admiral Thrawns chiss name is Mitth'raw""nuruodo).

The Grysk Hegemony are another race from the Unknown Regions. They are known for being able to subvert entire races of people to their will, but we don't exactly know how (all we do know is they can take the joys and fears of species and use it against them, hopefully it is expanded on in the future, perhaps in the Thrawn Ascendancy books). But, the important thing is they can make people do their bidding (they call these people ""clients""), though I would be interested if they can do that to a Jedi or Sith.

Back to the theory:

In *Thrawn: Treason*, it is revealed that Thrawn is working as sort of a double agent, working for the good of the Empire and the Chiss. He works with Chiss Admiral A'alani to defeat the Grysk's. Before this book, in the first one *Thrawn*, Thrawn sent Eli Vanto to work with the Chiss and it is revealed in *Thrawn Treason* that he is helping figure out how to extend what the Chiss call ""Second Sight"", but its actually the Force, so its more powerful even as you get older, since it normally decreases in power with age. In *Thrawn: Alliances*, Darth Vader does something similar to this to navigate through the Unknown Regions. Since it seems that Thrawn still has loyalty to the Chiss, then it seems quite plausible that after the Space Whale thing in Rebels, he ends up either going back to the Chiss or being picked up by them.

So I see a few possibilities:

1. When Thrawn and Ezra were hyperspaced out of Lothal, they ended up somewhere being picked up or running into Admiral A'alani or another member of the Chiss Ascendancy. Thrawn orders Ezra locked up, and Thrawn is trying to help the Chiss expand into the galaxy while Ezra is in the brig of the *Strikefast* (A'alanis ship). Eli Vanto and Assistant Director Ronan would probably show no sympathy to him as he is a Rebel and a Jedi.
2. Thrawn and Ezra had to work together, perhaps to defeat the Grysk, and they are now working together to defeat the Grysk Hegemony, who have been slowly building power in between Rebels and Return of the Jedi, and Thrawn is trying to pool resources to defeat this new threat (Thrawn mentioned multiple times in *Thrawn: Alliances* and *Thrawn: Treason* that the Grysk's could easily bring entire systems under their influence without anyone in the Empire noticing). So we could see a new threat emerge, and if there is a series that takes place after Rise of Skywalker, the rebuilding government could be forced to fight a new enemy, one that isn't a Sith Lord, but the Grysks.
3. The Grysks and Chiss aren't a factor at this point, and this theory is completely wrong.

But to conclude, I think it is completely possible that Thrawn and Ezra are fighting the Grysk's together, without anyone in the Galaxy knowing, or Thrawn may be back with the Chiss and Ezra is locked up. It will be fun to watch what happens next and what happens in Ashoka, and my theory could even potentially be the premise for a movie trilogy (I speak for a lot of people when I say I want a Thrawn trilogy). Now, whether Thrawn is a good guy or bad guy is interesting, but I love him as a character and would love to see him in many future projects to come.

I love Star Wars to death, and have for most of my 22 years here, but I keep a healthy detachment from the media I consume. I life my life, work, gym, music. I've never been moved to tears for it. Until now

Luke Skywalker was my childhood hero. I was a nieve, innocent kid, and I was targeted by bullies. And as you get older, you realise the world isnt such a nice place. As Rocky said, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there if you let it. But characters like Luke, who showed a 9 year old me how perseverance, bravery, and kindness can overcome anything, stay with you, and help you persevere long into the weird thing that is adulthood.
Seeing my childhood hero like we always knew he could be, a master of his own self and abilities, and still so kind, caring, and compassionate, honestly moved me to fuckin tears. And what hit me JUST as hard was the final goodbye between Grogu and Mando. These are characters I didnt even know only 16 months ago, and here they are, keeping me crying like a baby.

This may sound kinda sad and honestly I get it. But I had kind of moved on from Star Wars. You grow up, you get older, and the new movies weren't my thing. But The Mandalorian has brought me right back to that innocent, bullied kid who saw Luke Skywalker as his hero.

\-Because Ahsoka is alive, she was able to help Din get Grogu to Luke Skywalker, seemingly to become his first apprentice, since Ben Solo isn't even a twinkle in Han's blaster at that point, Leia can't tell Luke not to train anyone until Ben is old enough. Yet, Grogu isn't mentioned in the Sequel Trilogy. 

\-During the Mandalorian S02E04 (The Siege), tanks containing beings that resemble Snoke are seen at an Imperial Research Facility, and it is discovered that the Scientist requires Grogu to finish his research, because he needs his blood due to its high ""M-Count"" and that Facility is destroyed. This research seems to tie into the Tanks seen in ROS containing Snoke Clones and the means in which Palpatine projects his soul into a clone also. Perhaps the absence of Grogu implies he was never rescued, and the research was successful in creating Force Sensitive Clones.

Because of those two points, several other plot holes arise in the Sequel Trilogy (among the ones that already exist without any help from other sources).   
\-If Palpatine can't project into a clone and if Snoke can't be created, Ben can't be seduced to the Dark Side and Kylo Ren doesn't exist  
\-If Palpatine can't project into a clone and if Snoke can't be created, there's no leader to the First Order, and no Final Order or Sith Fleet.   
\-If there's no First Order, there's no need for the Resistance (weird that they existed in the first place considering the Republic should have been fighting the First Order, especially since Leia was a General in the Rebellion, Daughter of a Senator, and you'd think the Government would listen to such a huge figure head that was key in freeing the Galaxy from the Empire if she warned them of a new threat) 

I'm sure there are several other issues that are caused with the story because Ezra brings Ahsoka back from the dead, but I'm very curious to see where the future of Star Wars goes in series like Ahsoka, Rangers of the New Republic, and A Droid Story and weather they will further deviate from the continuity into the Sequel Trilogy.

The main idea is using feints and quick strikes. The style consists of heavily telegraphing attacks, luring the opponent's lightsaber away and then swiftly striking at the unprotected areas. One way this can be used is by striking downwards and then turning the lightsaber to one side to strike at an exposed part of the body.

The force will be employed in this style to sense when an opponent is anticipating the feint. When such an anticipation is detected, a feint will be telegraphed but then the feint will be turned into another feint and then strike at another exposed part. This move can be repeated until a successful strike lands. Since I'm still a little new, this might not be accurate to how the force works.

The new canon has made the books pretty murky due to the ever-changing Mandalorian culture and the whole “Order 66” change, but I still think it holds up.

I feel it tied very well into The Force Awakens and kind of made me appreciate that movie more. Part of the book really stood out to me, and I feel it should have been a flashback within the second movie of that trilogy. 

***Warning book spoiler ahead***

A critical point in the book is when on the galactic Senate floor it is revealed that Luke and Leia are the offspring of Vader. The immediate outcry of the senate is that Leia should be stripped of power and it is even suggested they shouldn’t trust Luke and potentially should create a plan to counter his power. 

After the senate meetings, Leia sends a holo message to Ben (who is training with Luke and not available to connect for a live message). We learn Ben didn’t have knowledge of his relation to Vader and Leia apologized for the deception. 

My opinion, is this should have been included in the movies. I picture a flashback that shows the moment in the senate followed by Luke and Ben receiving Leia’s communication. Based on the reaction of characters in the book, this revelation would have shook the new Jedi Order. Members would have lost trust in not just Luke, but also Ben. The inclusion in the story further explains not only Ben’s path to the dark side, but  gives reason to Luke’s seclusion as the galaxy lost faith in him and the Jedi. 

Additionally, if Filoni ventures into a retcon of the new trilogy. I feel this moment could be critical to explaining the development of new characters and their lack of involvement in the final battle with Emperor 2.0. If the current members lose enough faith, you could see the young Jedi (maybe including Grogu) leave his temple to seek a new Jedi leader, prior to the fall of Ben/Kyle Ren.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1758308,public,self,,,"Bloodline Book, New trilogy, and Filoni Retcon theory",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/l4v388/bloodline_book_new_trilogy_and_filoni_retcon/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And This is the order I am following:
•
•
•
1. Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace (32 BBY) ✔️ Rate: 7/10 by me

2. Star Wars: Episode II — Attack of the Clones (22 BBY) ✔️ Rate: 9.5/10 by me

3. Star Wars: Episode III — Revenge of the Sith (19 BBY)

4. Solo: A Star Wars Story (13 - 10 BBY)

5. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (0 BBY)

6. Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope (0 BBY/0 ABY)

7. Star Wars: Episode V — The Empire Strikes Back (3 ABY)

8. Star Wars: Episode VI — Return of the Jedi (4 ABY)

9. Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens (34 ABY)

10. Star Wars: Episode VIII —The Last Jedi (34 ABY)

11. Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker (35 ABY)
•

And don't mind the Rate and the ✔️ it's because I like to rate movies/TV shows. And I only have watched two of them and was going to Start 3th Episode
So should I follow this or The Chronological Order?
And thanks for advance for reading this and for commenting. ||| I took this list from here: [Tom's Guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/how-to-watch-the-star-wars-movies-in-order) |||

I know there must have been hundreds of such posts, but I thought this’d be a good place to try to put into words what I’m feeling after watching the sequels for the first time.

I’m feeling very conflicted, I guess. I think I enjoyed the movies; that is, I don’t feel like I actually disliked any of them. Having said that, I can’t help but feel like they just didn’t fit - they felt to me like the writers’ sole experience with Star Wars was reading summaries of the original three movies. 

It’s probably important to note that the prequels were ‘my Star Wars’ when I was growing up, and that is certainly part of my issue, but I feel like even if I had come to the prequels after the original trilogy, I would feel the same way - the sequels feel disconnected from the whole. I wasn’t expecting them to be bringing up midichlorians or having gungans playing bit parts at every opportunity, but the absolute absence of any reference to anything beyond the original trilogy (besides two tiny references in RoSW) just felt so *alienating*. 

Where were all the old aliens? There were dozens of new alien designs, but not a single unnamed/background character was of a race previously seen in the franchise. Even species seen in the originals like rodians, twi’leks, bith, ikithorians, etc. were conspicuously absent. The same was true for droids - I was glad that we at least saw one more droid like BB-8 in TLJ so that it didn’t feel so obviously unique, but the general absence of other astromech or protocol droids felt really odd. Then there were the planets - they barely gave more than a passing reference to where they were or were going at any point, and the only time they actually even mentioned a planet or moon seen before in the franchise, it was of course Endor. 

Again, this is possibly just a viewpoint borne of my initial exposure being the prequels, but the main thing I love about Star Wars is how big the galaxy feels, how interconnected and lived-in it all seems, and that was just strangely absent from the sequels. Yes, they visited a host of different worlds, but none of them except Exegol had any sort of introduction short of just flying there immediately after being brought up. None of the new background alien species stood out enough or had attention drawn to them sufficiently to create that interconnected feeling when they were shown on different worlds. That’s how it felt to me anyway. 

As regards the movies themselves - the plot, characters etc. - I didn’t have too many problems with them. The humour felt a bit clumsy, like it was from an Avengers or Pirates of the Caribbean movie, but it wasn’t deal breaking. I liked the main cast well enough. I didn’t really get the hate for Rose. I didn’t especially love her, but she wasn’t as bad as the internet hate made her seem to me before I’d seen her in action. The twists and reversals I’d heard about between TLJ and RoSW didn’t strike me as particularly egregious. I will admit that the films became increasingly reliant on deus ex machina as they went on, to the point that RoSW could barely move forward without it, and some of these developments did leave me wondering if the writers had even bothered to think of an explanation during development. Having said that, I know a lot of people complained about certain uses of the force depicted throughout, especially the force healing in RoSW, but force healing is hardly new to Star Wars, and we’ve seen plenty of ridiculous uses of the force before, from things as visually clear as force flight to more nebulous abilities like battle meditation, so that didn’t bother me too much. 

Ultimately I feel like I could have enjoyed them a lot more if they just felt more like they were in the same universe as the first 6 movies. A few twi’leks or rodians here and there, a casual reference to Coruscant or Kamino, and I might have been able to properly love the sequels. As it was, I found myself enjoying RoSW more than the first two, even as bloated with deus ex machina as it was, simply from the moment Palpatine spoke that line: ‘the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural’, which reminded me that this was in fact the Star Wars I knew and loved after all.

Probably during Ahsoka's trial arc (517 - 520), although Palpatine is seen in these episodes I think there may be some room for Palpatine to sneak out of Coruscant and attend matters with Maul.

However, in the third issue, Jedi Tiplee is seen without her twin and is killed later, so that would make the comic be located after the Conspiracy arc (601 - 604, when Tup kills Tiplar and Fives investigates Order 66), the comic would probably happen during the Clovis arc (605 - 607). But then, in the fourth and final issue, we see Talzin being killed by Grievous so it would locate the series to be later in Season 6 of TCW. It should be after S6E9 because Talzin is alive and battles against Windu. So then, the comics series would have to play during Yoda's arc and end before the last episode of S6.

Between The Lawless Episode and Yoda's arc, there seems to be a time-lapse of weeks or months so that would mean that Maul had been captured for at least three weeks which seems unlikely because the beginning of the comic makes it look like it is right after The Lawless episode. I know this storyline was originally intended to be an arc for TCW but was released as a comic before Disney decided to decanonize the EU. Some say it's Legends, some say (even Wookiepedia) it's canon and some say it is both.

One of the biggest complains of the turn of Iden and Del Meeko is how quickly it happens. If the story of these two characters were followed over the course of 3 seasons to show the evolution it would’ve been much more received across the Star Wars fandom. I believe it could’ve gone as followed:

S1: show the true Might of the empire at this point. Show how powerful, technological superior and advanced Inferno Squadron is at peak power. This would all take place pre Endor. Focus on building the characters of Inferno and Iden’s father with their absolute loyalty to the Empire. Maybe give some humanizing moments that forces Iden to follow through with orders her heart disagrees with beginning to sow the seeds of realization the empire isn’t all good.

S2: This is where the main storyline of BF2 would pick up. Starting with Endor and following through. I loved the story told and it would be a lot of fun to see this taken into live action. High point would definitely be that Jakku season finale.

S3: Follow the Resurrection storyline. Again, it would be fantastic to watch the transition of Iden the rebellion soldier to mother. Plus how awesome would a Kylo appearance have been.

From one fan who loved the BF2 storyline but understood the complaints. I think this offers a fun medium to expand.

I think the Force Awakens is a great film. The Last Jedi was ok but I wasn’t the biggest fan. And the Rise of Skywalker was enjoyable for what it was. 


So one of my biggest pet peeves of the sequel trilogy is that there was no time gap between episode 7 and episode 8. I think that this was a missed opportunity to allow our new characters to develop before the next time we see them. So here is my idea for how it could have gone :) 


Firstly, rather than BB8 having a map that leads directly to Luke, he instead has the details/map of an unexplored part of the galaxy and this is where Ach-To and Luke are. 
But the resistance are unable to find where because there is no information to show them where this part of the galaxy is. That is until R2D2 wakes up and reveals that he has a corresponding part to the map which when combined with the image projected from BB8, pinpoints the area of the galaxy that Ach-To is in. (In a similar way to how BB8’s map puzzle piece fits into R2’s map). 
This is the point in which the film ends. After Leia declares that now there is hope. Hope that they can bring Luke home. Hope that Luke can help bring Ben back to the light. Hope to restore peace to the galaxy. 


The Last Jedi now opens around a year later, with Rey and Chewy navigating a treacherous, unmapped part of the galaxy, as close as they have ever been to finding Luke. During this year while they have been searching, Rey has been training in the force. Honing her connection with it in order to try to find Luke. With no teacher she has spent most of this time meditating and instead of focusing on physical combat training, and been focusing on her mental connection to the force. She’s also used the time to study Luke’s lightsaber and has tinkered with her staff and has developed herself a lightsaber, however it’s unusable as she does not have a kyber crystal to power it. 

We learn this from the opening crawl, and through dialogue between Chewy and Rey. 

Trying again for the next time, Rey meditates and searches for Luke. Searching for him in the force. This time she senses something and this is when they find themselves at Ach-To.  

When she finds Luke the story would be basically the same, however just further forward in time. The resistance storyline can still be the same but just with Finn already back to full health. Poe could be 3rd in command, under Leia and Holdo. 

Rey could still continue to use Luke saber for the events of this film, however when it gets split in half you could show the actual kyber crystal splitting in two as well. Then rather than putting Luke’s saber back together again she could use her abilities to “heal” the crystal and then use it to power her own saber, in honour of Luke’s sacrifice at the end of the film. Her saber could still be yellow/gold as this could represent the fact that the crystals had been healed. Then this way we get Rey using her own lightsaber in the Rise of Skywalker. 

Dam, writing this out like this actually really makes me want to write it out as a fan fiction. Would anyone actually read it?! 😂

Before anyone rages in the comments, let me just get a few things out there:

1 - This is 100% my opinion. If you find this super interesting and feel like it enhances your experience of Star Wars material, that's great! Just a personal gripe

2 - I am fully aware that in an order of warrior monks who all fight using the same weapon there will inherently be styles of combat they teach there

3 - Even though I don't like them, I still accept that they are canon and don't think they should be retconned or written out of the franchise

All good?

Now for my thoughts:

In the films, (specifically the PT, when these were actively taught) it never seems like any of the characters look different from each other in combat unless they have a unique lightsaber (Darth Maul, Count Dooku) or they are physically different from the usual human lightsaber-wielders (Yoda). They all kind of have the same defensive and offensive moves that look good on screen, even though Obi Wan used x style and Dooku used y and Qui-Gon used z, and so on and so forth. So when I read about what is all entailed in each of the styles, I don't really connect any of them to the characters who apparently use them.

They honestly read to me like horoscopes or Zodiac signs where they are all vaguely applicable to everything, just slightly different enough for people to say ""see! They used THAT move! It's clearly Makashi!"" when you could reasonably apply most forms to whatever is going on. And like horoscopes, when I read through what they are and all what is entailed in each style my eyes kind of glaze over and I just get bored. Sometimes it feels like they were introduced just to add one more thing to the checklist for every Jedi's Wookieepedia page.

As I mentioned above, it is totally believable that the Jedi Order teaches specific types of lightsaber Combat and that there would be techniques for blaster deflection as well as offensive and defensive moves, and I have no problem with that. I just find it so tedious when it seems like EVERY character needs to be squeezed into one of these 7 categories (six, if we're being honest, since apparently vaapad is a super special form that only Mace Windu knows, which is a whole other rant...). It makes everything seem really limited in lightsaber combat and again, I have never noticed a difference between styles in any movies / tv shows, etc. If anything, an order that has been around for 1000+ years with so many different types of alien species of varying physical capabilities should have way MORE than 7 styles or ""forms"" of combat, but that just becomes way too convoluted.

Maybe that's part of why I enjoy the lightsaber combat more in the OT and ST. There's no nonsense about forms and techniques (since Luke, Kylo and Rey never learned them) just people trying to kill each other with their laser swords.

Anyway, just my thoughts, feel free to tell me why I'm wrong in the comments below lol",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1757224,public,self,,,HOT TAKE: The Seven Forms of Lightsaber Combat,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/l4c5nt/hot_take_the_seven_forms_of_lightsaber_combat/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

\-Why did poor Luke get crammed into a compartment with Han and Chewie, while Ben got one all by himself? The compartments don't look that big to begin with, and I would think it would be tight in there with Han at almost 6 feet and a 7'+ Wookiee, who probably doesn't smell that great! And Luke would likely want to stay close to Ben since he admires him so much (for good reason). It would have made more sense to split them up 2 and 2.

\-Where are R2 and 3PO? They couldn't get in or out of those compartments without a lot of help, and they're obviously not in them. And as far as anyone on the Death Star knows, ""the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff"". Vader even asks the officer if there were any droids, but the officer tells him no. So after Han and Luke lure the stormtroopers up into the Falcon and stun them (which we only hear), they obviously use the uniforms (and one happens to fit the shorter Luke perfectly...?) to leave the Falcon. So now there's 4 bodies, stunned or killed, right inside the Falcon. What did they do with them? Toss them off? And nobody saw that? Or did they do that right before they took off to escape the Death Star?

Anyway, with all the other stormtroopers guarding/watching the Falcon, how did the droids (and Ben, for that matter) get off the Falcon and into the control room without anyone noticing? As far as I can tell, the ramp is the only way on or off the ship when it's landed.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong: as one of my other posts says, I love the movie, and I'm sure there's other inconsistencies, flubs, continuity errors, etc. in all 9 movies.

Let's start with the simple, we are introduced to R2-D2 when Padme's ship is attacked and he is just some random astromech repair droid who happens to be successful in repairs. We know C-3P0 is built by Anakin to help his mother. Easy enough to swap their places, as C-3P0 is capable of flying a ship and ordering around droids, so he can easily be placed in Padme's ship in a similar capacity.

So why have R2-D2 built by Anakin on Tatooine? Throughout the whole series R2-D2 has this incredibly unique personality that we only really see in one other droid (BB-8), that to me seems pretty uncharacteristic of just some random astromech droid. By altering the story so Anakin creates R2-D2, it's reasonable to see that the boy genius created a completely unique droid capable of emotion and fierce loyalty.

Throughout the entire series we see R2-D2 perform some incredible acts thinking of his feet and a connection with his current owner that is so in-tune one could even say they are acting on the same frequency. In the Clone Wars Anakin even goes so far as to return to a dangerous battlefield to find and save R2-D2 from the void of space.

To add even more to this, R2-D2 and C-3P0 essentially swap places in the Clone Wars, with C-3P0 being one of Padme's senate aides while R2-D2 frequently copilots for Anakin or Obi-Wan. Why not just have C-3P0 with Padme in the first place?

I wanted to share this and see what your thoughts were!

""I think it is fairly clear that E.T. is from the species of the Star Wars galaxy, probably having come on a generational ship, since the journey would be very long indeed. Since the Force pervades the galaxy and everything in it, and can be used for purposes of manipulating it, I think it's reasonable to assume that E.T.'s ""magic"" did use the force *at some level*, even if it wasn't as directly as a Jedi would have (there is precedence for this, I believe the Force-witches of Agamar, as well as several of the cultures Jacen went and studied with).

However, I don't think E.T. was a Jedi, at least as we know them in the Star Wars time frame.

* First, though perhaps not most compellingly, we didn't see E.T.'s lightsaber, and a lightsaber is almost a part of the Jedi, they are almost naked without it.
* Second, consider whether there were Jedi on the ship the Brodo Agosians/Children of the Green Planet sent. If not, then one of them over the generations would likely have discovered the Force and started using it, probably passing down the knowledge, if not the genes for it. But since he or she would not have been trained in the force, the culture around it would probably not have been the same. This could easily lead to the level and manner in which E.T. used it.  
If there were a Jedi on the generational ship, then either the training could have died out due to a lack of trainees (recall Jedi are not supposed to have children, and an original Jedi would likely have adhered to this) and then they'd be in the Jedi-less situation described above, or the training could simply have evolved over the years as a natural progression. After all, there wouldn't have been a Jedi council to keep it on track, and the situation on a generational ship would not need to serve the same purpose as in the galaxy at large.

So I think that yes, E.T. was on some level using the Force, but no, he was not a Jedi knight, at least as we know them from the Star Wars era.""

That Luke is being conceited, not caring that Leia's whole planet was destroyed.

Some people go beyond this joke and completely miss the character's motivations in this scene.

Luke was some farmboy who, in a single day, had his entire family killed. Then, once he finally felt like he had some stability with Ben who was going to teach him the force and become a new father figure, he's killed.

Leia, on the other hand, understands loss. She has been fighting the Empire for a long time, as shown in Star Wars: Rebels, and has come to understand the risks and loss a person must deal with when fighting such a force. As a leader in the Rebellion, and when the rest of the Rebels will now be looking to her since her father died, she understands there are times where she must put her feelings aside to deal with the situation at hand. This attitude is evidenced when she is tortured by Darth Vader, and later saved by Luke. Leia knows where she's going and what to do next, while Luke feels utterly lost and alone.

TL;DR

Leia understands loss, and thus consoles Luke, who has never before felt so alone in the galaxy before.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1756121,public,self,,,Luke is devastated at Obi-Wan's death because his whole world died,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/l3tk17/luke_is_devastated_at_obiwans_death_because_his/,,all_ads,6,,,,,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What piece of content, mainly canon but Legends is also fine, do you wish more people would talk about?

And no, The Clone Wars, Rebels, etc. does not count. Not a day goes by that someone isn't posting here or on those specific subreddits asking if/how they should get into those shows. I'm referring to content that is actually little known to the public at large, not something that shows up in front of them every time they open Disney+ (BTW I love both of those shows more than the movies, just trying to avoid predictable answers).

For me, it's the Doctor Aphra comic. Yeah it's been a big success going for 40 issues and then a reboot, but its not something any casual fan would recognize and honestly I think it's some of the best original content we've gotten since the Disney acquisition. The comics are adventurous, intense, zany, and manage to poke fun at the more ridiculous features of the Star Wars universe while still harboring a great deal of love for them at the same time. 

All the characters are memorable, from the murderous but lovable droids Beetee and Triple-Zero, to the imposing Wookie Black Krrsantan, to Aphra herself, who remains one of the most compelling Star Wars protagonists IMO. Her ability to bring complete chaos wherever she goes is endlessly entertaining, and yet we still get some great moments of insight into her as a character. Throw in some fun antagonists like the head of Imperial PR who wields a public influencing railgun and you've got an unforgettable ride from start to finish.

The comic honestly feels like it can stand alone from Star Wars, in the best way possible, though I'd be surprised if Aphra herself doesn't appear in something animated or live action in the next couple of years (I'm still holding out hope for The Mandalorian, she'd be a perfect ally and then presumably antagonist for Mando after she inevitably betrays him...). 

As someone who does not usually buy comics, I cannot recommend it enough, and with all the trades for the first run out and the omnibus on its way, now is a great time to start.

Well, that's my pick. Sure there are other things I adore, like the novels Thrawn Ascendency and Light of the Jedi, but the former is about to become far more relevant thanks to the Ahsoka show and the latter is very much in the center of online discussion regarding the High Republic as a whole..

So I know Bo-Katan worked with Ahsoka during the siege of Mandalore at the end of the clone wars but that really doesn’t explain how she knows where Ahsoka is 20 some odd years later. It’s not like right before Ahsoka left she said “Oh hey so after the Empire falls you can tell any mandalorians who are traveling with a 50 year old dyslexic frog who happens to be a baby to find me on this planet”. Also I know Bo-Katan appeared in rebels for a couple episodes but that was when Ahsoka was dead so I don’t think they ran into each other.

* fighting droids on naboo, escaping trade federation, and saving jar jar

* worldbuilding and side quests in gungan city

* navagating a ship thru naboo's planet core

* rescuing the queen / r2d2 puzzles of fixing the ship engines to escape the blockade

* world building and side quests on tattooine to get enough money to buy parts from watto. one side quest/story can be jar jar vs sebulba

* wattos shop for character upgrades or skills, like upgrading c3po to unlock language for more quests, or upgrading anakin's podracer 

* podracing!! nuff said

* fighting darth maul (boss battle)

* world building and side quests on coruscant: puzzles of anakin trying to prove his force powers to the council, jedi training 

* 3 story-driven fights on naboo (gunfights to capture nute gunray, gungan fights vs droids, and space battle with starfighters attacking the federation control ship) happening in parallel (intermediate checkpoints switching between the 3)

* fighting darth maul again (final boss battle)

like this game would have everything. space battles, underwater navigation, podracing, puzzles, shooter, stealth, lightsaber fights, open-world nav, quests, fantastic story, and prequel memes.

That being said, I think anyone familiar with Legends can tell that Thrawn being name dropped in Ahsoka--which is confirmed to be connected to a larger, overarching story with Rangers, Mando S3 etc--means that they're planning a canon version of the Heir to the Empire within the shows (especially the Ahsoka series) with Thrawn being the main bad guy at first and the Grysks (Vong in Legends) being the true villains/threat. 

**||This is a theory I wrote on a different Star Wars page||**


Ok so I was thinking about the ""Mandoverse"" and I remembered while thinking of possible ways it could play out  that in Legends Thrawn was assassinated by a trusted bodyguard while he was in the process of trying to take control of the fallen Empire, while at the same time preparing/defending the galaxy from the Vong (Grysk in canon.

MY THEORY: Thrawn will be assassinated by the one he trusts most and his only friend, **Eli Vanto** .


I think Thrawn will have suffered a mental break (which makes sense due to the fact that him and Ezra were aimlessly floating around in the unknown Regions for who knows for how long. (Theory: before being rescued by the Chiss Ascendancy).

On the planet of Tenebra, an important planet that houses a large Jedi Temple, is ambushed by the Sith after initiating a large scale attack to take over the holy site and turn it into a massive academy to train new Sith warriors. A struggling but powerful Sith apprentice, Darth Villihan, marches alone towards the jedi temple, with an army of battleships battling the Republic overhead, his master attacking the south entrance of the temple with his legion of Sith Integrity Knights with a transport of 50,000 troops marching towards the temple as well. He looks upon the building that has placed him on this path of destruction. Memories come flooding in as his anger boils underneath. 

Then, a voice calls out to him, a familiar stab in the back. ""Villihan!"" His former master called his name. Villihan looks in front of him as Delari comes into view from the entrance and walks steadily towards the temple steps. With shock, he speaks some more ""What are you doing?"" Villihan speaks with some surprise ""I never thought I would come back here again. It's almost surreal, too bad it will be up in flames when I'm done with it, along with the jedi who tried to kill me."" That hurt Delari to the core, as his failure begins to surface again ""Please...stop. I dont know what I have to do to make this madness stop but please, this isnt the way to make things right."" Villihan let's out a growl ""You think you can make this right? Do you remember what you and your fellow masters did to try to make things right? What you had to do in order to make future jedi powerful against the Sith? I'll tell you what happened. I felt my master ignore my calls for help as I was being beaten for days, electrocuted for hours as the Jedi played the roll of Sith!"" Delari looked sorrowfully at his old friend ""I tried to help, I really did, the Council wouldnt let me see you. I tried everything I could to see you, but I couldnt feel your presence, I felt darkness, hate, anger and I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didnt try hard enough to let you skip the trial of Flesh that was my fault. But please, leave the others out of this, leave the masters, the knights, and the younglings out of this. They dont have anything to do with this"" ""THEY HAVE EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THIS! They were the ones who made my life the way it is! Do you have any idea how many people I have slaughtered....how many planets I have conquered just to get to you? Too many, now, I want to make all of those deaths worth everything when I kill every single Jedi in this Temple, because that's what it felt like when you left me: it felt like everything I ever cared about DIED with me, and now it will die with you""  Villihan turns his crimson blade on and launches towards Delari. Villihan let out a gut wrenching scream as he rushed towards his enemy. He leaps over the countless amounts of steps and slams his blade as hard as he could to end his former master quickly. Delari turns his on at the last second and blocks it, staggering back. 

As the battle wages, ground forces land their reinforcements in giant troop carriers. One such carrier had a horrifying army created with the darkest of alchemy. A Sith general stands beside this transport, ""Release 'The Damned'!"" The door crashes to the ground as a darkened room gets slightly illuminated. A horde of decomposing sith, who were vessels of the dark side, came sprinting and shuffling out of the ship and began to kill everything in their path, even unlucky Sith Integrity Knights and Masters who stood near. Their screams and footsteps could be heard from the 2 mile buffer that separated them and the east side of the temple. Having already took the north and south side of the battlefield and making their march towards the temple, the Sith make their attack on the east and west due to the Jedi's hard defense. 

Villihans master, Darth Endante, was advancing in the south with his legion of Knights as they finally encountered a small group of jedi masters waiting for them. Endante, without saying a word, motioned his arm towards the masters and the group of Knights slaughtered them with precision. Turning his lightsaber on, he ran toward his own personal slaughterhouse. 

Saber clashes echoed off the temple walls and columns as former master and apprentice battled each other. Flashes of Delari training with Villihan started to blind Delari as he silently pleaded with his former apprentice to stop. All he wanted to do was stop this fighting and bring who he would call a son back to the Order and try to mend their relationship. As they fought, or as Villihan kept violently slamming his blade at every angle, Delari was remembering what started all of this. 

Flashback time: 10 years ago, when Villiham was only 16 and getting ready for the Trials that he was finally prepared for, despite the Councils eagerness to start years before when Delari objected given his great power. When the trials came, he succeeded in most but one: The Trial of Flesh, a brutal test of ones pain tolerance by means of electro shock torture and beatings, as the Jedi believed that if these trials arent authentic enough, the Knights of tomorrow would succumb to the dark side. Vilihan was nervous, but his master assured him with a smile that he would do great. But, when the padawan was experiencing all the torture, he snapped and destroyed the equipment and killed the men who were in charge of the torture. Villihan escaped the planet as fast as he could, frightened beyond repair and full of confusion and anger that his master would put him through this. 

(Extra Lore time bois) 

Weeks had passed and the Sith Empire grew in size, and one day, a Sith cruiser found Villihan, barely alive with food and supplies that he used the last of his credits to buy. They took him aboard with little resistance as he was weak. They were about to execute when the Sith lord Venitris ordered something else: why kill the boy when they could use him for their conquest, in due time. But first, they had to break him of any remaining light that was left. Weeks and months of grueling pain made Villihan the dark lord he is today as he conquered many worlds. 

These flashed in Villihans head as he slammed his blade against the man who, he had thought, wronged him, murdered his fantasy friends and almost killed him as well. 
Then, as he was blinded by hate, Delari attacked for the first time, slicing both hands clean off with a frustrated and painful yell, as he was forced to hurt his former student. Collapsing against a pillar, all the anger subsided for a moment, now filled with shock. Seeing Villihan writhe in pain made Delari turn his saber off and tend to his friend. But Villihan shrunk away like a scared boy, only glancing at his master with his bright yellow eyes. ""Why....why didnt you come help me...why couldnt you defy the council this one time? I was in so much pain and I was hoping that at any second you would come to help me... Why?"" His voice was shaking as he sat there curled up, looking away of course. ""I thought you were ready, for the first two days at least, you were doing great, better than any other padawan, but then I sensed you were in so much fear on the third. I ordered them to stop, that you weren't ready, but they said it was too late, that you would be expelled if they stopped. I didnt want that, and i didnt think you wanted that either. You trained for Knighthood for so long, I thought that stopping it would make you resent me. I thought that in time you would not give in to the fear that plagued you in that moment, that you would be strong, but I was wrong.

It was a condensed version of the movie, with audio straight from it, including dialogue, music, and sound effects, and narration by Roscoe Lee Browne. I listened to it so many times that it wore out and it sounded warped! But I eventually knew it by heart.

Then once the original trilogy was released on VHS, I watched them many times. (I don't mind some of the added stuff and the ""tweaks"" for the Special Editions, but I much prefer the original, unaltered movies.) I don't know Empire and Jedi quite as well, but I do know a lot of the lines and such. And of course, they're now on TV often enough that I'll turn it on, and sometimes recite the dialogue along with them, much to my wife and kids' annoyance...!

I've also seen Raiders of the Lost Ark and Back to the Future enough times that I have them memorized too. (Same with some of the Pixar and Marvel movies.)

On Wookiepedia it states that ISDs use a solar ionization reactor and further down in the article it states that hypermatter is annihilated within to create huge amounts of power.

My question is, if hypermatter is used as a fuel then how is it harvested in large quantities? I saw one guy state that it can be harvested as a ship travels through hyperspace but surely that would only account for that ships own personal fuel, no sources were sited for this claim either.

I genuinely enjoyed TLJ. It felt like a Star Wars movie that was... *Fresh* 

I loved the originals, as they really put out this gorgeous world and really developed the main characters in a flawless and downright incredible manner. (Seriously, Luke in RotJ from ANH was like a completely different person).

The prequels hit different. We KNEW the villains were going to win at some point in time but somehow the victory the sith attained still felt very emotional and unpredictable in the way it was presented.

The sequels? Well The force awakens was generally well liked, I personally enjoyed it. But I always felt that it was a movie that invoked the inner nostalgia within the Audience. Obviously since this was the first Star Wars movie in a decade. 

But The Last Jedi was an absolutely incredible movie in my eyes. It didnt copy any of the previous films like Force Awakens did to A New Hope. It went a separate route to what any fan’s theories did (Rey being a nobody and the Origins of Snoke to be exact). It took the high risk of being a completely different Star Wars movie from the others, it showed the imperfections and flaws in seemingly perfect heroes. It showed Luke’s imperfections at being a Master and Leia’s imperfections at being a parent, two characters who were portrayed to be perfect in heroism in the originals. Not to mention, the incredible visuals and cinematography of the movie. 

I always felt that I was supposed to hate the film since everyone hated it. But I really couldn’t. Just as I liked the prequels back when everyone else hated it. 

The only mistake The Last Jedi did in my point of view was that they became way too original. To the point it became a *good movie* but not exactly a Star Wars movie. I always thought one of the reasons why people liked Force Awakens over The Last Jedi was due to the “Original Trilogy” essence that TFA had but TLJ lacked. TLJ was the least Star Wars film to have ever been produced, but was that really a bad thing?

But how did this ruin the sequels? Well Rian Johnson made a *Great Movie* yes. But failed to create an open storybook for Future directors (JJ Abrams) to write about. I mean TLJ literally strayed away from every hint and plot TFA attempted to build. In the effort to make an unpredictable and plot twist filled movie, RJ made it harder to create a one movie long sequel to what he did.

Maybe if TLJ was a standalone Star Wars film rather than a centerpoint of a Trilogy then we mightve been blessed with a well loved Star Wars Movie and a Great Trilogy. The Rise of Skywalker was doomed to fail due to the “Greatness” of The Last Jedi.

I just had to state an opinion. Id still choose the prequels and Originals over the Sequels any day of the week. But I genuinely enjoyed 2/3 of the movies released in the Sequel trilogy, but obviously I can’t say that because its apparently illegal to enjoy the sequels.

Then again, Im sure Future Star Wars Series are going to unite the fans once again.

But around three weeks ago I started my first watch of the clone wars series and finished it today. 

Firstly I don't know why I put it off for so long because honestly it's some of the best TV I've ever watched. And also I'm a sucker for watching cartoons and animation so again don't know why I didn't bite sooner. I think post Mandalorian I was curious about Ahsoka, Bo Katan etc... 

Secondly the last 4 episodes of the last season hit me so hard. It felt like the Revenge of the Sith I wish we had sooner. Order 66 this time around actually made me so sad.

Bravo to Filoni and the gang for their tremendous effort in world building and character development. And also for reminding me that once again TV star wars is better than most film star wars (personal exception for the OT &amp; Rogue One).

I also can't believe how much lore you learn from watching it.
For a kids show it's very fleshed out and intense.

Some thoughts and feelings post watch:

1. Very early on in watching it I got to thinking, a force sensitive bounty hunter would be such an interesting character. Then Ventress made her bounty hunting debut. So I would love to see more of that or whatever happens next for her.

2. Keen for Bad Batch and Ahsoka. And also really keen to see Bo Katan take Mandalore. (Haven't watched rebels yet but that's next)

3. Super glad Rex didn't go 66 on me. I would've been devastated.

4. Maul was always my favourite as a kid (I was a kid during the prequels), so to see him more fleshed out was amazing. 

5. Obi Wan is and will always be the maddest Jedi. He is stupidly powerful. But it was nice to see that even he had his weaknesses (Satine).

However, I have had a personal interest in this topic recently, and have compiled a lot of cool evidence. Spoilers about everything Star Wars. Please enjoy. 

Count Dooku was never a Sith, even despite his title, Darth Tyranus. As a side note, Jango Fett only knew him as Tyranus, so who even knew the Darth part of his title? Sidious? And who cared? Dooku? ""That'll show the Jedi Council..."" &gt;:) 

So, what was Dooku's motivation to become a Sith? 

Somewhat similar to Ahsoka, Count Dooku denounced the Jedi Order, citing their arrogance, and blaming the council for his Padawan's death on Naboo, Quigon Jin. With that, Dooku left the Jedi Order *after* Episode I, already seeing indefinite issues with the Jedi Order before the Clone Wars (talk about foresight). Additionally, Dooku confided in Kenobi in Episode II with great sadness that he wished they would have met earlier as Quigon spoke highly of him. Critically, Dooku wished Quigon was still alive, and said that he needed his help right now. As a side note, he also explained everything he knew about Sidious' plan including his current identity and for Kenobi to help him defeat Sidious.

Jumping back to shortly after leaving the Order, Dooku fought for the Separatists, still wielding his blue saber, which is not uncommon for darksiders at least in Legends. Darth Sidious gained knowledge of Dooku and recruited him for his cause. However, it is clear by Dooku's reaction in the beginning of Episode III that he had no clue he was a lamb for slaughter for Anakin. 

While a shot in the dark, and just a side note, I think it may have been Sidious' original idea to have Anakin defeat Maul on the Invisible Hand. Maul was a clear enemy, who already commited the crime of killing a Jedi Master. Its even almost a hint seeing Anakin's reaction when Palpatine says he hurt you, get revenge. It would have made more sense if it were Maul and Anakin heard that proposition (Maul *may* have potentially killed Kenobi too). Anyway, if Sidious hid that Anakin was being made that day from Dooku, it is likely he did not sincerely teach much to Dooku about the darkside. I won't even get into the details regarding ""true"" Sith training that typically includes psychophysiological torture (""missions"") for years and not dying. 

With this, what about his lightsaber? It's red - that's a Sith color, duh. Actually, Dooku was just handed a red crystal from Sidious. It is kind of weird. Sith (or at least trained ones) obtain a natural-colored crystal (e.g., blue, green, yellow). Then, they meditate on the darkside and their personal hate/suffering for hours or days, embuing the crystal with those emotions until it ""bleeds"" or cracks. In regards to Dooku, he was disappointed by the views and actions of the Jedi Order; he never showed such capability for those related darkside emotions. So, to me, it was almost like Dooku was using the Elder Wand, but it wasn't his. Even Kylo went through this process of creating his crystal. 

On the topic of saber combat, and importantly, Dooku did not disrespect anyone ever. It is overtly clear in the movies and Clone Wars show, he refused to duel unfairly. When he was a Jedi, He performed lightsaber displays with Yoda for the council, and knew he could win most duels fair and square (he also already knew Yoda was one of his only superiors in Episode II, and thus why he fled). 

But aren't Sith supposed to draw their power from the darkside in combat? Yes and even Mace Windu was more in-tune with his passion in his style against Sidious (a style which fosters the same). And while Dooku undoubtedly knew how to do all of this, he never came close to darksiders like Anakin fighting Obi-Wan in Episode 3. Seems like he didn't need to and/or wanted to do so. Most alarming about Dooku being a Sith is that whenever he dueled a Jedi, he still performed the traditional Jedi bow or ""Makashi salute"". He also appeared to defeat his opponents and then offer them a relatively safe surrender, holding firm to the Jedi way. 

But didn't he try to kill all of the Jedi on Genosis? Kind of, but didn't it seem like a fair fight? Dozens of Jedi vs. an army of droids and one bounty hunter. Yes, the goal of Dooku was for them to lose, but it was not a merciless slaughter. He could have easily blew them all up since they were all trapped together. Same thing with his weird Jedi vs. Animal show. He knew Jedi could escape almost anything, including chains. He was all about it being a fair game. Anyway. 

This flows into the next glaring point. Dooku was not a killer. He may have killed, but only as a Jedi has/would. Early in Episode II, Yoda and Windu discussed Dooku as a Separatist leader. Windu confidently stated that Dooku was a politician, once a Jedi, and did NOT have the capability to be a murderer. So, even being the leader of the opposition, Windu did not believe Dooku would give up his Jedi ways. I know the Jedi were not always right but I mean Annie slaughtered women and children as a Jedi, a bit early on too, haha. Dooku appeared to have views and trust that no longer aligned with the Jedi Order, similar to Ahsoka and even Kylo. Of course, Kylo was fully motivated to try to embrace the darkside afterward. 

So where is Dooku's passion for the darkside? I recently saw a Youtube video, which partially fueled this post. They discussed Dooku and the lack of Sith eyes (i.e., yellow eyes). Sidious and Anakin seemed to almost always bare Sith eyes, especially when honing the darkside. Dooku never displayed these eyes, and in congruence with the points above about the lack of related emotions, it makes sense to me. No fully drawing from the darkside means no Sith eyes. Yes, Dooku used lightening and other darkside attacks. Though, Jedi are not banned from these attacks, just discouraged. 

For instance, force crush is utilized by Jedi on robots a lot, just discouraged. Why? Because you could be a Jedi Master in the heat of the Clone Wars and crush someone's chest, causing them a permanent disability (i.e., Windu caused Grevious' cough and torturous longterm condition this way). In Legends, Luke also posed undercover as a reborn Sidious' apprentice, and almost lost himself to the darkside practicing these attacks. As well, lightening has been utilized by other gray Jedi throughout Legends. And smh, Rey used it by accident in Episode IX. Anyway, it is likely the emotion behind the attack and the frequency or submission to the power/emotions of darkside attacks. 

So, Dooku remained disciplined and held honorable ideals across the board. Dooku was almost more of a Jedi than the council. He was tricked by Sidious insofar as his role and Sith training. His only tells were that he was a Sith was a meaningless codename, a saber crystal linked to someone else, and the use of lightening that any forceuser could use with proper caution; I am not sure who would display more caution in combat than Dooku. 

TLDR; Dooku was more of a Jedi than most Jedi, and was fooled insofar as his role and training as a Sith by Sidious.

*An orphan from a desert planet comes into possession of a cute little droid, who drags the orphan into a cosmic struggle between a rag-tag group of freedom fighters and a powerful, oppressive force.  The orphan joins the freedom fighters and while doing so, discovers their own connection to the Force, a mysterious cosmic power. Along with the freedom-fighters, the orphan helps destroy the oppressors' planet-killing spheroid weapon. Sadly, they also lose their mentor figure, a surrogate father, who helped them start to discover their part in the larger world.*

Quiz: What Star Wars movie am I describing?

Ok, that was a joke (mostly), but it does set the tone for the main lines of reception to TFA. As Lucas famously remarked privately after screening it with Disney execs, ""Nothing here is new."" This neatly, if in a somewhat oversimplified way, summarizes much the *good* and *bad* of TFA. But here are some more detailed thoughts. As always, comments and disagreements are happily welcomed below.

The Good: The new heroes are easy to like and identify with right away. Without a moment's pause, I found myself rooting for Finn and Rey, and upset and concerned about Kylo Ren. (I already talked about this stuff in the original post so I won't belabor it.)

Also, how we run into the old heroes as the story goes on is really fun, esp. Han and Chewie's entrance.  Han and Leia reuniting was also fun with 3PO getting in the way as he did so long ago on Hoth. Even the opening scene, with Lor San Tekka ""She'll always be royalty"" was a beautiful nod to the princess we love.  

It also has a few *Star Wars Moments*. These are the moments you always remember for shocking twists or deep meaning. Ones that leave theaters in explosive cheering or gasps, or leave us thinking or talking about them when we walk out of the theater.

My favorite moments are the duel between Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan and Maul, Yoda drawing his saber to duel Dooku, Sidious' speech in the Opera House, Luke's putting the computer off during the trench run, Vader's reveal in could city (the ultimate Star Wars Moment) , and the redemption of Anakin Skywalker though his son's love and sacrifice. (Notice one for each movie 1-6 were just given; there are others, including a certain cameo in Mando 2.8, which is now one of the best moments).

TFA's main ""Star Wars Moment"" was the scene with Kylo and Han. It was powerful, shocking, and a  momentous shift. Asking his father for help, we think Kylo might come back, and be redeemed, but then he kills Han in an attempt to try to fully embrace the dark side. It was terribly sad to see one of our most beloved heroes go, but JJ gave Han had a chance to be Han in his own glorious way in the movie up to that point. No just his heroism, but his sardonic remarks. ""That's not how the Force works!"" felt like Han, and my family were laughing and also reveling in our old friend. His boldness helped save the day yet again, and he gave Rey and Finn a chance to team up with the Resistance. His speech about the Jedi stories gave me chills. ""They're true. All of them."" He was honored, even as his death was painful. 

There was also a lost moment. Mark Hamill was **absolutely correct** that if Luke showed up to catch the saber that Kylo was pulling on Starkiller Base, it would have been one of the most explosive joyful fan reactions ever. Indeed a Star Wars Moment well worth remembering. But, alas, a missed opportunity (which is a bit of a subtheme of the treatment of Luke from my perspective . . . )

Now the neutral: Nostalgia. Yes, it *feels* like Star Wars to me. The action, friendships, excitement and comedy all together have the joy of Star Wars. For many (and I'd guess, most) fans relationship with Star Wars is primarily emotional, so things like seeing the Falcon for the first time were nostalgic and joyful. The way that ""Fan service"" is used as a pejorative nowadays by fans who think they are sophisticated is kind of off, imho. When done right, it is joyful. The are our old friends and such gestures done right, not mere pandering, are moments to savor.

Still, the story is *so* close to ANH that it borders on a meta-joke. The franchise didn't need a reboot. Who hasn't seen SW films already? It's not like they were reviving some 50's era sci-fi serial. You can still watch the films and they hold up. Unfortunately, and ironically, to serve nostalgia, he ends up undermining the successes of OT heroes. The act of telling something very close to the original story makes him take away the successes of Leia and the group so that they are back to being understaffed rebels fighting a much bigger force. We are no further than we were at the end of Empire Strikes Back. (I said this before, so I won't belabor it.) A similar story could have been told without using a planet-killing superweapon. I mean, really.

More neutral: Mystery boxes. We all know JJ is a mystery box fan. And to be fair, he has spoken about how as a child some of the most fun he had with SW was speculating with friends about gaps in the story. And he's right. Headcanon is a fun part of it. That's one reason why subs like the Maw Installation are so popular. But to leave out *massive parts* of the framing of the story, so we don't know why it's even called The Force Awakens (something about the cosmic force finally awakening a period after the sith were destroyed or something). Or the political framework that at least makes it a little less than a complete and utter Rebels vs. Empire motif (which was left to an author in a novel to explain). These could have been done better.

The bad: JJ is a fan of ""EXTREME!"" and ""DIRE!"" contrivances, which work at times, but too much is just cheap. When Poe tells us about Starkiller base ""We wish it were just another Death Star"" (paraphrase), I groaned a bit. More diminishing of the OT heroes for the sake of the new guys. And not even necessary. 

All that said, we left the theater excited about Star Wars again. My girls and I loved Rey and were excited for her to find Luke, who was the McGuffin of the entire film. The magic was back and we were ready for the next adventures. Finally, after 30+years, Luke, the greatest hero of modern cinema--my hero from the age of 3--would really show up. . .

- Before you get your lightsaber you can use weapons imitating the lightsaber

On the planet of Tenebra, an important planet that houses a large Jedi Temple, is ambushed by the Sith after initiating a large scale attack to take over the holy site and turn it into a massive academy to train new Sith warriors. A struggling but powerful Sith apprentice, Darth Villihan, marches alone towards the jedi temple, with an army of battleships battling the Republic overhead, his master attacking the south entrance of the temple with his legion of Sith Integrity Knights with a transport of 50,000 troops marching towards the temple as well. He looks upon the building that has placed him on this path of destruction. Memories come flooding in as his anger boils underneath. 

Then, a voice calls out to him, a familiar stab in the back. ""Villihan!"" His former master called his name. Villihan looks in front of him as Delari comes into view from the entrance and walks steadily towards the temple steps. With shock, he speaks some more ""What are you doing?"" Villihan speaks with some surprise ""I never thought I would come back here again. It's almost surreal, too bad it will be up in flames when I'm done with it, along with the jedi who tried to kill me."" That hurt Delari to the core, as his failure begins to surface again ""Please...stop. I dont know what I have to do to make this madness stop but please, this isnt the way to make things right."" Villihan let's out a growl ""You think you can make this right? Do you remember what you and your fellow masters did to try to make things right? What you had to do in order to make future jedi powerful against the Sith? I'll tell you what happened. I felt my master ignore my calls for help as I was being beaten for days, electrocuted for hours as the Jedi played the roll of Sith!"" Delari looked sorrowfully at his old friend ""I tried to help, I really did, the Council wouldnt let me see you. I tried everything I could to see you, but I couldnt feel your presence, I felt darkness, hate, anger and I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didnt try hard enough to let you skip the trial of Flesh that was my fault. But please, leave the others out of this, leave the masters, the knights, and the younglings out of this. They dont have anything to do with this"" ""THEY HAVE EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THIS! They were the ones who made my life the way it is! Do you have any idea how many people I have slaughtered....how many planets I have conquered just to get to you? Too many, now, I want to make all of those deaths worth everything when I kill every single Jedi in this Temple, because that's what it felt like when you left me: it felt like everything I ever cared about DIED with me, and now it will die with you""  Villihan turns his crimson blade on and launches towards Delari. Villihan let out a gut wrenching scream as he rushed towards his enemy. He leaps over the countless amounts of steps and slams his blade as hard as he could to end his former master quickly. Delari turns his on at the last second and blocks it, staggering back. 

As the battle wages, ground forces land their reinforcements in giant troop carriers. One such carrier had a horrifying army created with the darkest of alchemy. A Sith general stands beside this transport, ""Release 'The Damned'!"" The door crashes to the ground as a darkened room gets slightly illuminated. A horde of decomposing sith, who were vessels of the dark side, came sprinting and shuffling out of the ship and began to kill everything in their path, even unlucky Sith Integrity Knights and Masters who stood near. Their screams and footsteps could be heard from the 2 mile buffer that separated them and the east side of the temple. Having already took the north and south side of the battlefield and making their march towards the temple, the Sith make their attack on the east and west due to the Jedi's hard defense. 

Villihans master, Darth Endante, was advancing in the south with his legion of Knights as they finally encountered a small group of jedi masters waiting for them. Endante, without saying a word, motioned his arm towards the masters and the group of Knights slaughtered them with precision. Turning his lightsaber on, he ran toward his own personal slaughterhouse. 

Saber clashes echoed off the temple walls and columns as former master and apprentice battled each other. Flashes of Delari training with Villihan started to blind Delari as he silently pleaded with his former apprentice to stop. All he wanted to do was stop this fighting and bring who he would call a son back to the Order and try to mend their relationship. As they fought, or as Villihan kept violently slamming his blade at every angle, Delari was remembering what started all of this. 

Flashback time: 10 years ago, when Villiham was only 16 and getting ready for the Trials that he was finally prepared for, despite the Councils eagerness to start years before when Delari objected given his great power. When the trials came, he succeeded in most but one: The Trial of Flesh, a brutal test of ones pain tolerance by means of electro shock torture and beatings, as the Jedi believed that if these trials arent authentic enough, the Knights of tomorrow would succumb to the dark side. Vilihan was nervous, but his master assured him with a smile that he would do great. But, when the padawan was experiencing all the torture, he snapped and destroyed the equipment and killed the men who were in charge of the torture. Villihan escaped the planet as fast as he could, frightened beyond repair and full of confusion and anger that his master would put him through this. 

(Extra Lore time bois) 

Weeks had passed and the Sith Empire grew in size, and one day, a Sith cruiser found Villihan, barely alive with food and supplies that he used the last of his credits to buy. They took him aboard with little resistance as he was weak. They were about to execute when the Sith lord Venitris ordered something else: why kill the boy when they could use him for their conquest, in due time. But first, they had to break him of any remaining light that was left. Weeks and months of grueling pain made Villihan the dark lord he is today as he conquered many worlds. 

These flashed in Villihans head as he slammed his blade against the man who, he had thought, wronged him, murdered his fantasy friends and almost killed him as well. 
Then, as he was blinded by hate, Delari attacked for the first time, slicing both hands clean off with a frustrated and painful yell, as he was forced to hurt his former student. Collapsing against a pillar, all the anger subsided for a moment, now filled with shock. Seeing Villihan writhe in pain made Delari turn his saber off and tend to his friend. But Villihan shrunk away like a scared boy, only glancing at his master with his bright yellow eyes. ""Why....why didnt you come help me...why couldnt you defy the council this one time? I was in so much pain and I was hoping that at any second you would come to help me... Why?"" His voice was shaking as he sat there curled up, looking away of course. ""I thought you were ready, for the first two days at least, you were doing great, better than any other padawan, but then I sensed you were in so much fear on the third. I ordered them to stop, that you weren't ready, but they said it was too late, that you would be expelled if they stopped. I didnt want that, and i didnt think you wanted that either. You trained for Knighthood for so long, I thought that stopping it would make you resent me. I thought that in time you would not give in to the fear that plagued you in that moment, that you would be strong, but I was wrong. I should've done something to help you.""",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1754946,public,self,,,"This is a silly fan fic I made, would like constructive feedback.

It reveals Darth Plagueis to have followed her, her entire journey. Rey is the Sithari. Plagueis is the one who saved the Skywalker saber, and hand. He enchanted the saber so it would call to her. He was Luke Skywalker in Episode 8. He brought himself to Krait to distract Kylo Ren, to further Rey’s training. (Lifting rocks) The real Luke Skywalker is in the unknown regions with Grogu, and the Ghost Crew, or at least Ahsoka, Ezra, and Sabine. (The Luke in ROS that is the ghost is him though.) I would have Rey train for a time being under Darth Plagueis, whose spirit was reborn inside his ancient Jedi Master, Tor Valum. You heard that right. I would take the part of Tor Valum (from DOTF script) and make him into a Jedi Master, the prime Jedi, who trained Plagueis in the light side, when Darth Tenebrous taught him the dark. I’d have Plagueis be the opposite of Windu. Uses light side powers when it benefits him. But would give his life to the Sith. So Plagueis would teach Rey Sith Alchemy, something we haven’t seen in canon really. He tells her the phrophecy. The Sith’ari, who will lead the Sith. If she can summon enough dark energy, she can resurrect the dead! This is where it ties the sequels together. She finds an alter deep within the temple. She placed the body of Ulkar, and Teedo, whom she killed, the Necklace holding the Sith crystal, the Sith dagger, the spare wayfinder, and jar jars body (that is a whole thing I realize I didn’t delve into here. So if you guys like it, I’ll explain. I will even write a full synopsis!) Two things are missing. The ritual requires 5 sacrifices. Plagueis brings a severed hand. Luke’s severed hand. Plagueis says, “this is the severed hand of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Being the ‘Chosen One’ this hand contains the amount of Medichlorians of a regular being, so this should be sufficient. That makes 4.” He concluded. “Actually, that’s all I need,” she says, stabbing the body of Valum in the chest, killing him instantly. He is placed on the alter. Rey reads the ritual text from the book. The one holding the Sith prophecy. The power saps from all of the cadavers. All of the tools. The cadavers, tools, and alter all turned to dust. “Good, my apprentice. You have finally done it!” A voice said behind her. Plagueis had become a force ghost. Not as the body of his master. As himself, who we saw in legends. But that is impossible, right? Sith can’t become force ghosts? Well he did. He followed Rey outside the temple, as it began to crumble and collapse as parts of the cave holding the temple began to become dust. The cave faded and temple fell into the sand dunes of Jakku to be buried forever. Rey tells him she has lived and rode through the sands of Jakku all her life. Plagueis laughs. “My child, these sands have known many names. It is now called Jakku. But In the days of the Republic, before the empire, it was known as Moraband. And In ancient times before Lord Bane, it was known as Korriban. It is the ancient graveyard of the Sith. It is time, Sith’ari, to lead our army!” Rey turned to him. “Thank you, wise teacher. Thank you for watching over me. Thank you for leading me. Thank you for teaching me, both times. You will be remembered fondly.” Rey says as she tears up. Plagueis seems puzzled. He grabs her hands with his own, “My child. You speak as if I am dead? As if I am leaving you? I don’t intend to. I attend on leading our army together. The Sith will ru-“ he begins to say as he is stopped. His blue hue begins to deteriorate. (They would have the same exact exchange as Ben and Tor in DOTF.) Rey successfully absorbed a Force Ghost until they cease to exist. She raised her arms, focusing and began to bring the Sith Order back to life. There was 100 at least! That’s how I would tie in the dark side part. I’d have to flip the protagonist roles around. But that’s how I’d adapt the DOTF script. I would make it more Sithy. More Culty. One of my favorite things about ROS. Although ROS gave Rey a Jedi ending, it also brought her closer to the dark side than ever.

We had an entire movie about Luke learning about failure and rising above it. The problem is that he already had that character arc in Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. His story has been told. For a franchise that ""wanted to focus on the new characters"", Rian sure put a lot of effort into telling a story about Luke.

And who suffers the most from this? Rey and Finn.

While Luke is retreading his previous heroes journey in the span of one movie, Rey is left on the sidelines to do nothing but nag at him until she gets fed up and leaves. She might have learned some lessons form Luke and his failure, granted. But she's essentially sidelined in favour of his depression and redemption.

Rian Johnson and co had absolutely no idea what to do with Finn. If you completely remove Finn's character from the movie almost nothing changes for the main plot. He should have been a Jedi. Rey should have taken him to Luke, who would have taught her force healing so that she could save Finn, after we find out Luke's reason for leaving was to seek guidance from the ancient Jedi texts about how to help Ben. After finding nothing that could help him, that's when Luke should have fell into depression, in my opinion. But Luke should have acted as a guide, a teacher for our new characters.

I told him it was a show that was part of Star Wars and I decided to introduce him to the movies since he had never seen them before.

I was going to start off with the Phantom Menace but the prequels don't really make sense if you haven't seen the OT first so I showed him A New Hope instead.

He wasn't super into it at first, but as the movie went on he started to become more interested. He loved Darth Vader and the Storm Troopers, I explained to him that Darth Vader was the guy in charge and they were part of the Empire and the Rebels were the good guys who were fighting them. 

He yelled ""NOOOOO"" when Obi-Wan got sliced by Vader and kept asking me if he comes back. Then he couldn't stop laughing when the Death Star blew up.

When I showed him Empire Strikes Back I told him this is the movie where Luke meets his dad, since he's so little he never got the ending spoiled for him by pop culture. It's a magical thing watching a little kid lose his shit when Darth Vader tells Luke he was his father the whole time. Other highlights were AT-AT'S exploding, Yoda existing, and Luke fighting Vader. He also really liked Cloud City for whatever reason, he kept asking me if it was in any of the other movies.

Return of the Jedi was his favorite though, I told him this is the movie where we meet ""Darth Vader's boss"". He couldn't even comprehend the idea of a guy being more powerful than Darth Vader. He knew about Palpatine from the last film but now he was finally going to see him in person. I planted the idea in his head that ""Luke is PROBABLY going to have to fight both Vader AND The Emperor at the end, at the same time"". I left it a bit ambiguous. The whole Luke vs Vader fight at the end along with Han, Leia, and the Ewoks trying to turn off the shield generators was probably his favorite scene in the entire series.

Then there's the scene where The Emperor is torturing Luke with his force lighting, my little brother was expecting a typical hero moment where Luke managed to power through everything and kill the emperor. Then Vader threw him over the railing and I've never seen someone lose their shit that hard before, this kid didn't even show this much emotion at Infinity war lmao. It was perfect. He loved every second of it.

This show has been honestly incredible and it only further cements my head canon of the Filoni-verse.

Anyway recently I noticed that a lot of people watching Starwars for the first time seem to really enjoy the sequels and obviously a lot of kids like them and little girls look up to Rey etc. So my theory is in 15 - 20 years the sequels will be just as beloved as the preqeuls are now.

Something that had always bothered me about the Star Wars Prequels was that Palpatine carefully planned out everything, except for the Tusken Raiders killing Anakin's mother. I think that was a MAJOR part of Anakin's fall to the dark side, and I always figured it was just chance, which undermines Palpatine's scheming. But what if Disney added the scenes in Mandalorian as a subtle way to show that Sand People CAN be negotiated with. Because if anyone can negotiate with them, Palpatine certainly can. What if this shows that Palpatine did somehow convince the Sand People to kidnap and kill Shmi Skywalker, thus pushing Anakin closer and closer to the dark side?

In many versions of the Arthurian story, Igraine is a married woman who is lusted after by King Uther Pendragon, who eventually uses Merlin’s magic to disguise himself as Igraine’s husband in order to deceptively seduce her. She is impregnated with Arthur, and Uther has her husband killed that same night and then marries her.

A similar plot would have worked great in the prequel trilogy:  Young Anakin is smitten with Padme, but she is infatuated with the dashing young Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi, who is too virtuous to notice her in that way. She thinks Anakin is an annoying disturbed kid and she will never consider him as a romantic partner, which infuriates the jealous and frustrated Anakin, who can’t help but notice how she is practically throwing herself at the clueless Obi-Wan Kenobi who never gets the hint. 

Anakin uses the force to disguise himself, fooling Padme into thinking he is Obi-Wan, and seduces her, with leads to awkward interactions with the real Obi-Wan until they figure out what happened. Obi-Wan is pissed, Padme is mortified, Anakin is humiliated. Things get tense between Anakin and Obi-Wan.

I've seen the movies and I enjoy The Mandalorian. So while I know a bit about the lore, there is still a lot I have no clue about, one of those aspects being how the dark side influence your personality. 

I remember commenting one time that Anakin having a therapist would have solved a lot of problems, but someone replied that the dark side is more complicated than that. They described it like the dark side seduces you in a way and changes you. I didn't really understand his explanation. 

I remember in the movies how they refer to Vader and Anakin as two different people, and also Ben Solo and Kylo Ren. In a separate comment on a different post, I was adamant that if Ben survived episode 9, he should face punishment for his crimes. It caused quite the debate as other fans defended him, saying how essentially Kylo Ren and Ben Solo are two different people. 

So my questions are, does the dark side create a separate personality that's entirely it's own? Is it like full on possession or does it only enhance darker traits you already have? Because I always believed villains should face the consequences of their crimes, but that becomes murky if they essentially have a magically induced split personality disorder.

For those who didn't read any legends material a Ysalamiri is a lizard creature from the planet Myrkr. They live on trees and get nutrients from the bark but their most impressive ability to repel the force by creating a sort of bubble around themselves. The more Ysalamiri there are the further out this bubble reaches. They were used by Legends Grand Admiral Thrawn to protect himself and imperial crews from the insane clone of Jedi Master Joruus C'baoth to great effect.

Joruus was very popular and while not as powerful as the Emperor still demanded respect. Using the Ysalsmiri Thrawn stopped C'baoth's force lightning cold before it could reach him.

Now I'm pretty sure we all know about Grievous. The kaleesh warlord turned cyborg jedi killer. Trained in the jedi arts by Count Dooku and told never to engage jedi unless he had fear, surprise and intimidation on his side. He became a notorious slayer of countless jedi including jedi masters. He did not always have the trifecta of factors Dooku taught him about especially against the likes of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Though on more then one occasion he would have killed the latter despite this. 

We know that Grievous was always at a disadvantage against jedi he couldn't break using fear, surprise or intimidation as shown with Mace Windu. The force is very powerful and Mace was able to crush the great General's chest with little effort. Against the likes of Anakin Skywalker or even his master he would be no match.

But what if he had a tool that could remove the force from the equation? The force not only allowed the jedi and sith to lift objects or shoot lightning, it was also used to enhance their physical abilities and reaction times. With those abilities gone as well it's likely the jedi would simply become like any other of their species save for their physical condition and years of training. With these factors Grievous would be able to crush any jedi he went up against. 

While it's true the jedi would eventually figure out the secret and devote resources to taking out the Ysalamiri it would take time. They would also more then likely use clones to shoot the creatures or even slash at them in a duel it would depend on the scenario and even then a slash toward the creature could leave them open. If Grievous hides the creatures or even ensures there are none to tell the tale the ability to employ countermeasures is stretched even more.

I'm certain if he did indeed find the Ysalamiri the Confederacy as a whole would more then likely attempt to use them with their droids leaving the jedi even more vulnerable. Sidious of course might even consider using them with clones for the great purge. 

It also kinda leaves Grievous in a dangerous position. Because they now have Ysalamiri to use with droids why would they need him anymore save for his intellect and using him as a scapegoat? Dooku and Sidious might even see a General they can't control with the force too dangerous and dispose of him or they would employ cybernetics within his body so they could control him once more.

I find the idea fascinating and I feel it would really complicate the original timeline. Though since all we know about them in Disney canon is Thrawn had a pair of sculptures depicting them it's hard to say what they're like now.

It is not meant to be pro or con or whatever, but honest reflection by fans that has both personal responses as well as longer-term analysis. I thought to do it because I have written so many comments in discussions here and there, many quite long, and I wanted to put all of my thoughts in one place. There are a number of quality posters who I sometimes agree with and sometimes disagree with, and their thoughts are scattered throughout comments here and there. I hoped that they could put responses such that this could be a sort of document of our mature thoughts.

As a 44 year old man, I've sure been thinking about Star Wars a lot lately, probably spurred by the Mandalorian. But I don't feel bad or awkward. Non-ironically, it is the mythology of my youth, and as such, as worthy of discussion as the Homeric myths, the great tales of the Mahabharata or the Arthurian legends. 

The point of these posts isn't to argue why one particular take on the sequels or any of the individual movies must be the right one. It's just to digest them a bit in hindsight. Different people may disagree reasonably. But it is to put them out for conversation in one place. Let's try to do more than partisan sniping though, if we can all avoid it (myself included!). As much as possible, maybe we can try to avoid easy ""x sucks"" sorts of stuff, as well as ""you don't like x, so you must be bad/dumb/socially unjust"" etc. 

This first post is big-picture, and my plan is to have ensuing ones on each of the films. Any thoughts or disagreements are welcome. 

To be forthcoming, my personal take on the sequels on a whole is mixed (more on this below). But in general, as a gen-x'er who saw ANH in the theater in about 1981 (it was re-released) and saw Empire and ROTJ in theaters too, I remember the internet-fueled prequel hate of the early 2000's and I don't want to perpetuate that stuff (I supported ""Thank the Maker."")  I want to be fair and not pile on the sequels just because it's trendy now either. 

That said, this initial post is a bit more from the heart, not a calculated assessment, with a big-picture sense of the sequels before we look at them more closely. It does have some criticisms.

Big picture, what is compelling about the sequels for me is the characters. I find the heroes engaging and easy to root for. Ben Solo is a good villain. While Rey is a bit OP in some ways, she does fail a lot mentally (esp. in TLJ), which is sometimes ignored by people saying she's a Mary Sue. The actors were great and really sold me on the characters. Adam Driver was a revelation, and a new take on the internal life of a dark-sider. Unlike Dooku, who craves power and influence, or Vader, driven by fear of loss, Kylo is torn between a legacy he feels he can't live up to, and the promise of being his own man by breaking from any bonds--even those of basic morality. It's clever and interesting. 

 And on the whole, the films do *feel* like Star Wars, with the drama, action, and heart mixed with humor that is generally true to the characters (well, *mostly*, but we can talk about that more on the TLJ post, lol.)

The thing that mostly inhibited my having unbridled appreciation of the sequels is that IMHO, instead of building upon the promise and storylines that came out of the success of RoTJ, they just wiped away any of the promise and successes of the OT heroes (and, for that matter PT), such that by the end of Episode 9 we are no further than we were at the end of Episode 6 (in fact, in some ways, we are worse, since Luke went from promising *hope* to *failure*, and the other OT heroes were pretty much failures by any measure. Leia didn't build a New Republic. Han and Lando didn't gain the joyful domestic lives they earned in the OT. Anakin did not vanquish the sith as the Chosen one. And so on

I don't think it was an intentional strategy by the directors/screenwriters to undermine the OT characters and Anakin's achievements out of spite. But I do think they did not sufficiently prioritize \*respecting their achievements\* as a major desideratum that constrained the sequel storytelling. They were too concerned with their own stories coming off well. It's a pet peeve of mine when later storytellers, after a major arc is finished, just remove the successes or promise of the earlier heroes so the new guys can have something to do. Also when they undermine previous lore because they need to make their heroes important (looking at you, Legend of Korra!). This sort of storytelling can be lazy and, in a way, disrespectful. 

To use a non-TLJ example: that JJ would make Leia not go hug Chewie after Han dies, but just pass him by to greet Rey, whom she does not know, seems like he wasn't giving that much thought to the OT characters and celebrating *their* relationships. ( At least he apologized for that scene.) JJ also never gives the three (what to speak of four, with Lando) OT heroes a chance to see each other again. They each pretty much die alone, except for Lando (and I'm really happy he's still in universe being awesome as always). But their lives didn't have to be this bleak to still have a good set up for the sequel heroes' adventures.

So, big picture, there's a lot to like in the sequels. The characters are cool, the cinematics are good, and it *feels* like SW. I like Rey and I'm glad my girls could see a cool female Jedi front and center. There are a lot of beautiful scenes and cinematic moments. But the way they didn't prioritize the legacy of OT heroes, the heroes that made us love SW, is hard to forgive

All of this said, my family is going to do a SW super-watch (all the movies with CW and Rebels and Mando in order, maybe even throw in the OT Thrawn audiobooks after Mando), and I might like the sequels a lot more this time around. Who knows.

I also hope that F&amp;F will continue to tell stories about the OT heroes' adventures and lasting contributions and successes after ROTJ that will help contextualize the events of the sequels as a blip toward the end of their lives, not an erasure of their lasting importance just so Rey and the rest can do it for real.

That was really a lot of fun. It was the right thing to do, since we all hadn't watched the prequels for ages and almost everyone still knows them pretty well.

I was very surprised how well the film held up effects-wise and basically it left a pretty good impression. The new characters, the new planets and locations are just terrific. The Jedi team consisting of Qui Gon and young Obi are also very likable. Anakin could have been a little older so it would have been more fitting with Padme, Obi-Wan and his quite heroic actions as a pilot. I can't share the big criticism of Jar-Jar. Jar-Jar and is behavior is a too present but he is to a large extent a very independent character that has little impact on the overall film. I also find the criticism of the Midi-Chlorians (as they are exclusively portrayed in the film) to be completely inflated, as they don't seem to be connected to the creation or nature of the Force itself. The plot is unnecessarily muddled, sometimes there are minor inconsistencies and weaker scenes. While the dialogues are perfectly fine with the dub I've used, the original dialogue unfortunately suffer greatly from poor writing and wooden delivery (which probably was intentional on the part of the director). But on the whole the positives outweighs the negatives and towards the end we have one of the best lightsaber battles ever. I was pleasantly surprised and found it to be a great Star Wars film. Also, the soundtrack is just amazing.

Some of my favorite games of all time are kotor- the story of revan and meetra surik are just incredible to me and I hope that some day they come to the big screen. While I wait for ahsoka to come out I’ve been showing my wife (has never watched anything) things to catch her up and hopefully get her as excited about the Star Wars universe as I am. 

We are doing a chronological play through as best as possible, starting with 1-3 (skipped animated clone wars, just too long but I’ve seen it) and we are in rebels now. 

Now here’s my question: wookiepedia shows the mandalorian wars as legends content. However, in season 3 of rebels when kanan and ezra are training Sabine in lightsaber combat fenn rao brings her mandalorian vambraces. She equips them and quickly beats down Ezra with her new equipment and turns on kanan. Kanan becomes angry, beating her quickly and then going off about how the mandalorians lost the war against the Jedi and those tricks aren’t going to work. 

Outside of this conversation the mandalorians are always quick to start shooting at Jedi, which I could only assume is because they still feel their defeat from the wars. With the new disney rules on legends vs cannon, wouldn’t this make the wars cannon?

While I personally am not the biggest fan of them when compared to either the OT or PT I still think they have been treated super unfairly by the star wars fan base.

It seems to me that anything that changes or steps a little to the side of what was expected or written in fan theories in between the trilogies is instantly shunned and hated.

I remember the same thing happening when I was a kid and phantom menace was released. I was young but I had already seen the OT several times and was a massive star wars nerd already.

I went to the advance screening, dressed up like a Jedi, the whole deal, and apparently unlike most people who saw it, I loved it.

Jar Jar annoyed me, even at like 6 years old, but beyond that I thought the entire movie and story were absolutely amazing. 

I have watched it easily a hundred times since then, including just a couple of weeks ago as a 28yo, and I haven't changed my mind. In fact Phantom Menace is probably my favourite out of all 9 movies.

I will cop hate for that I'm sure but I stand by it due to being able to actually see it in the cinemas and all of its amazing new introductions to the star wars mythos. For example Qui Gon Jin (still easily the coolest Jedi), Darth Maul, Naboo, The droids and trade Federation, the whole galactic government and of course Pod Racing, just to name a few.

I do believe that Return of the Jedi is the better movie overall as far as commercial appeal, story etc. , but Phantom menace will always be my personal favourite. I remember how people reacted when it was released though.

Adults who grew up watching the OT were furious. In their eyes the entire franchise had been ruined. Never mind that if the OT never existed they would of probably loved it whole heartedly. Nevermind that it wasn't actually bad and it added to the story we all loved in alot of positive ways and only a few negative ones. It was still loathed.

Attack of the Clones did not help the situation by being easily the weakest film in all 3 trilogies but Revenge of the Sith was once again one of the top 5 movies of all 9 easily. It tied the story up really well and although people still hated parts it was received much better. 

Still though for years and years, well over a decade, I had to listen to people say these movies were absolutely terrible because they ruined the entire franchise. When  I asked why I would always get the same response, 'The originals were better'.

The exact same thing is happening now with the sequels. All of a sudden, the prequels are actually ok, but those sequels are terrible! They ruined the whole franchise! They are no where near as good as the OT or the cartoons or the Prequels!

It seems to me that the problem isn't with the product, it's with the fans. I include myself in this because for I while I was on the 'I hate the prequels' band wagon and as I previously stated I didn't like the sequels. 

I didn't hate them at all in comparison to most people, I still think they are amazing movies, but I am comparing them to what is easily the best Sci-Fi movie trilogy ever created and then getting upset when they aren't better.

Not only that but I'm always seeing people saying that they 'ruined the story' which makes no sense. That story has already been told. It is finished. This is what happened after. It is a different story. 

Is it upsetting to you when you have a child and it isn't exactly the same as you were growing up? No because it is a completely different human growing up in a completely different time. I apply the same mentality to the sequels and the prequels for that matter.

I don't like them because there were things I wanted to happen that didn't, beyond that they are all amazing movies and I don't like people saying they 'suck' when even the person saying it knows it's a lie.

I for one am really interested as to  exactly how and when he became disillusioned with the Jedi and how long he'd been plotting his betrayal on Umbara. Seeing as he was a Jedi Master, he must have done something right before his change of heart, but he's pretty despicable in the Clone Wars, so I'm intrigued to know what kind of person he was beforehand. I wonder if he knew Count Dooku personally when he was a Jedi, if perhaps he was always an admirer of his, hence his desire to become his apprentice (I know he wanted to be Dooku's apprentice because it'd put him in a position of power, but I'm curious as to whether they had any prior existing relationship when Dooku was a Jedi). 

I dunno, perhaps I'm over thinking it, but I always wished we'd seen Pong Krell at least in a cameo or something before the Umbara arc, like we did with Barriss Offee and Quinlan Vos before they turned to the dark side. It would have been more hard hitting if we'd seen Krell as a protagonist before his treachery on Umbara. I'm pretty sure Filoni said the original plan was for Krell to have a larger role in season 4 and for his fall to be depicted, and I kind of wish they'd gone with that, and I still kind of hope we see a pre-Clone Wars Krell in some format at some point, even if it's not a huge role. I've always been somewhat intrigued by him, as he's pretty damn awful in the four episodes he appears in, but it seems he was very much respected and admired by his fellow Jedi beforehand and that they didn't see his betrayal coming at all, so I'd like to know what happened. It can't have just been his vision, because rather than warm the Jedi what he'd seen, he chose only to help himself, which is obviously a very un-Jedi option to take.

NAME: Asrel ‘Runt’ Bilve

SPECIES: Quarren

HOMEWORLD: Mon Cala

PROFESSION: Mechanic

BIRTH DATE: 22 BBY

BACKSTORY: As a young boy on Mon Cala, Asrel always loved to tinker. He would build miniature versions of the Mon Calamari Cruisers, something his parents always frowned upon. 

Throughout the years, he began to adopt Mon Calamari tendencies, so much that he was eventually exiled at 16. He left the planet smuggled aboard a cruiser destined to the Rebel Alliance. 

Since then, he has worked as a mechanic, fixing the many ships that the Alliance has. As a pastime, he has learnt to pilot these ships, and has since been sent on his first expedition into the Outer Rim... 

If this gets popular, I will write a fanfic for this character as well as the final fanfic.

I started with the original trilogy, which was incredible and certainly had superior story telling.  (Much to the disagreement of my younger self.)

However, I watched The Phanton Menace tonight, and something surprising happened....... I cried.  It was the first time a StarWars movie has ever given me this kind of emotional response.

I found that the moments between Anakin and his mum were just so powerful, such as her love for him, that he had been freed and she would remain a slave, that he would have to leave her behind.  It was just so sad and the John Williams score was just so powerful and beautiful.

The various revelations, character returns, story, and that final reveal...ALL AWESOME!

BUT...I cannot help but feel that Season 2 is going to end up doing more harm to fans than good...primarily because I often start seeing calls for new movies or shows that feature fan-favorite characters getting live action appearances or returns. We’re talking everybody from Mace Windu to Hondo Ohnaka.

There’s nothing necessarily wrong with this. It can be REALLY awesome to see characters we love either or be brought to life in live-action. Plus with all the announced shows and movies coming to Disney plus, it’s fair we’ll see many more fan-favorites make their return.

But I’m getting the impression that THIS is all the fans want to see...more of the characters and stuff they’ve already seen. That’s NOT what we want. We just want to see new, high quality stories. The main reason Mandalorian works so well is because the creators gave us characters we can care about (including Baby Yoda) and putting them on an engaging, well crafted journey that doesn’t revolve largely on spectacle to work. As much as I personally enjoy the sequels, I can’t deny a lot of the decisions were more or less meant to be grandiose and cool-looking on screen which ends up costing empathy point.

And new stories also means new CHARACTERS. I don’t want fans to dismiss Star Wars projects because they don’t have characters or locations or concepts they don’t recognize. Because if all Star Wars does is keep showing the same people, places, and eras again and again...then Star Wars will quickly grow stale.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1752770,public,self,,,I think viewers are learning the wrong lesson from Mandalorian Season 2,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/l2di8l/i_think_viewers_are_learning_the_wrong_lesson/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Omniverse

According to this definition, the Star Wars universe is part of Marvel's Omniverse (as is supposedly every other piece of fiction, at least that's what they claim), they even mentioned Luke Skywalker (whether Lucasfilm endorsed this or not, I don't know).

They sometimes use this concept to explain intercompany crossovers in Comic Books, but some of the Marvel/DC characters are Omniversal, meaning they could - in theory - influence all other fictional worlds aswell, even though this may not have been the original authorial intent for those stories, so they would also influence Star Wars from the outside. 

The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe included this Glossary/explanation of the Omniverse: 

http://www.marvunapp.com/ohotmu/appendixes/omnapp.htm

The thing I really got hung up on is that one article towards the back of this page. In one of the paragraphs it is stated that every universe in the Omniverse has ""parallel universes"" that are identical up until a certain point, e.g. when a character makes one decision. Basically this part:

""Each decision made in the Omniverse diverges two or more realities, one where one action occurred and one where an alternate one occurred. [...] Each decision does not actually create or diverge a new reality, but rather the realities exist alongside and parallel to each other up until the point of divergence. The Omniverse may be conceptualized as a fraying rope, each thread a different reality, with strands splitting further apart from each other as time passes.""

This is how the Marvel Multiverse works, but according to this book, it applies to other fiction franchises aswell. However, I know for a fact that STAR WARS - being a very deterministic universe with prophecies and the Force - never alluded to a Multiverse like DC or Marvel's. The only thing was Waru's appearance in Legends, and even that was more of an alternate dimension of Spacetime than an actual parallel universe. 

I personally believed that STAR WARS was always trying to stay very grounded and realistic in that regard, not join in in this trope. The idea that every time a character in STAR WARS makes a decision (and there are a lot of those moments, frankly), there is a parallel universe where something else happens, just doesn't sit right with me. And even if there is a Multiverse in real life, it probably would not be like this (I personally prefer Linde's bubble multiverse concept, which simply includes a lot of separate universes that have differentlaws of physics and universal constants but that are not exact copies of each other). 

Also, the Omniverse was never mentioned anywhere in STAR WARS, and I am not sure whether Lucasfilm endorses Marvel's idea. 

What are your opinions on this, fellow STAR WARS fans?

DISCLAMER: I am not making fun of people who don't like the Sequels nor am I making fun of the people who believe this rumor, I am simply saying that the rumors are bullshit

There have been rumors that the WBW (World Between Worlds) will be used in the new Ahsoka Disney+ series to effectively ""Erase"" the sequels.

 First, that's not how the WBW works. In Rebels S2E22 ""Twilight of the Apprentice Part II"", Ahsoka fights Vader in the Sith temple on Malachor. during the end of the episode, we see her leaving the temple, and it is not explained how she survived until S4E13 ""A World Between Worlds"". In This episode, It explains that Ezra (The Main Character) saved Ahsoka by pulling her into the WBW. There is enough evidence to support my claim. First, Ahsoka surviving was always meant to happen according to the Season 2 Finale. This means that the time travel aspect of the WBW works differently from that of something like the *Back to the Future* trilogy or *Avengers: Endgame*

&amp;#x200B;

Second, During S4E13, we hear the following lines

REY: *""We'll see each other again, I believe that""*

MAZ: *""The Belonging you seek is not behind you...""* (Cuts off)

MAZ: *""That is...""* (Cuts off again)

(These are only the few that I could hear, If you have more, please let me know and I'll add them in an edit)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm going to talk about real world logic. It makes no sense for Disney to Erase a trilogy that made them over $4.4B in the box office,

Not only would they be losing money, they also would be erasing Carrie Fisher's final physical performance.

NAME: ASREL ‘RUNT’ B
SPECIES: Quarren
HOMEWORLD: Mon Cala
PROFESSION: Mechanic
BIRTH DATE: 22 BBY
BACKSTORY: As a young boy on Mon Cala, Asrel always loved to tinker. He would build miniature versions of the Mon Calamari Cruisers, something his parents always frowned upon. Throughout the years, he began to adopt Mon Calamari tendencies, so much that he was eventually exiled at 16. He left the planet smuggled aboard a cruiser destined to the Rebel Alliance. Since then, he has worked as a mechanic, fixing the many ships that the Alliance has. As a pastime, he has learnt to pilot these ships, and has since been sent on his first expedition into the Outer Rim... 

If this gets popular, I will write a fanfic for this character as well as the final fanfic.

Anakin’s fall to the Dark Side is actually pretty well done. At the very least he was almost set up to fail with a series of bad circumstances around him. Check this out:

\--

\-1-  He’s taken from his Mom as a 9 year old. When Mace Windu and Yoda later say Anakin is ‘too old’ they’re right (about one thing). He’s old enough to be attached to his Mom, be traumatized by leaving her with no certainty of when/if he’d ever see her again. So already he’s losing one parent at this young age.

\-2-  Qui-Gon becomes Anakin’s father figure, starting to impart some lessons on the young kid and start him on his journey to be a Jedi… before getting killed pretty quickly. Now a second parent is gone from his life, when Anakin needed them most.

\-3-  Anakin finally finds his Mom again after ten years in Episode II only to have her killed by the Tusken Raiders. So first he leaves his Mom for a seemingly endless summer camp he’ll never return from, has his surrogate Dad die, then finds his Mom again only for her to die too. This guy is pretty emotionally fucked up already.

\-4-  Obi-Wan is forced into the role of guardian for Anakin because of a promise to Qui-Gon. BUT… the identification of his role is misconstrued (no one’s fault, really). Qui-Gon was the father Anakin needed, and in Episode II Anakin even tells Padme that “he’s like my father” (referring to Obi-Wan), in a scene where he’s complaining about being held back in training. However, in Episode III, after Obi-Wan defeats Anakin on Mustafar, Obi-Wan says “you were my brother, Anakin.” Clearly Anakin needed a FATHER while Obi-Wan was being more of a BROTHER to him. That’s a BIG difference for guidance and growth of a kid.

\-5-  Anakin’s unhealthy level of ‘love’ for and obsession with Padme is due to a combination of losing his Mom (the only women he knew love for) and mistaking a young crush for eternal love (common for teenagers). He’s got no Dad or Mom to tell him it’s just young love, his ‘older brother’ Obi-Wan just looks the other way, and once he gets Padme pregnant he’s in it for the long haul. The crappy romance dialogue in Episode II is actually kind of brilliant because that’s the stupid way teenagers talk when they think they’re ‘in love’. When it fact they’re young, inexperienced, over-romantic, and haven’t gone through heartbreak to come out stronger. Anakin is an uber-powerful and emotionally unstable romantic teen. Gee, that sounds bad.

\-6-  The Jedi Council are also fuck-ups extraordinaire here. They’re dismissive of Anakin when Qui-Gon brings a little boy to see them, put him down constantly when he’s a teenager (telling him to ‘know his place’), and don’t even ATTEMPT any empathy with his emotional struggles. The only people that do are Obi-Wan as a kind, older brother and Padme as his romantic partner. But Anakin needs his mentors and teachers to TEACH HIM. That requires some kindness and celebration of accomplishments IN ADDITION TO discipline for mistakes and outbursts. Anakin only gets the latter, and part of that could be because A) he wasn’t raised as a baby to this so he’s not a cold, emotionless monk, and B) the Jedi are likely all wary and jealous of him because Anakin is more naturally powerful/talented than any of them. They should have channeled his power properly with some praise and some discipline— instead they just did the latter, which built more resentment in an emotional and moody teenager.

\-7-  All of the stuff lacking above was being provided to Anakin by the manipulative Palpatine. You have got to give it to the Emperor, the dude had this plan down pat. He played the role of Dad once Qui-Gon was out of the picture, praised Anakin’s accomplishments and complimented his growth (with none of the discipline, which probably boosted Anakin’s ego a bit too much), and encouraged Anakin’s feelings and aspirations (whereas the Jedi Council attempted to suppress them). For all of the Jedi doing what is right and protecting the galaxy they were really shitty at protecting the interests of their own. Everyone within the Jedi Order is disposable, taught to be emotionless, and believe so much in their knowledge to the point of arrogance. Obi-Wan is THE LEAST of that mold, probably when Anakin didn’t fall to the Dark Side sooner, as he showed some compassion for Anakin. But Anakin needed more than what Obi-Wan could have given him.

\-8-  Yoda and Mace Windu are were this should fall on hardest. Both were like uncles that COULD HAVE been more Dad-like roles for Anakin but just really didn’t give a shit. Mace is always mistrusting of and cold towards Anakin, while Yoda’s teachings are inflexible and lack the empathy for Anakin’s conflicted feelings. Several times Mace Windu remarks how he doesn’t trust Anakin, says (aggressively) “take a SEAT, young Skywalker” (to admonish Anakin and humiliate him in front of others), and even says “Are you sure??” in an accusational tone when Anakin tells him Palpatine is the Sith Lord.

\-9- Yoda just tells Anakin to let go of stuff he loves. Oh you love your Mom? Let her go. Love someone else, Obi-Wan, whoever? Let it go. You’re having nightmares? No big deal. Let it go. People get really inflexible and set in their ways as they get older. In the prequels Yoda is in his 850s so he’s REALLY set. That leads to malaise and nonchalance about other’s feelings. He may be wise and experienced, but he knows nothing about the turmoil of an emotional teens/early 20s like Anakin. Anakin looked to him for advice and guidance, but the guidance he got was basically ‘just deal with it’. That’s being dismissive, not exploring the angry and sad feelings a kid has so you can HELP THEM THROUGH IT.

\--

That said, I think it would be an injustice to Thrawn’s overarching character arc for him to face Ahsoka as some sort of imperial holdout, for the following reasons:

1) While Thrawn is certainly not a *good* character, he is definitely not evil either; whatever manichean binaries may exist in the realm of Jedi/Sith, Thrawn occupies a realm of moral grayness unlike other imperials and other Star Wars antagonists. While his tactics may be cruel, it is clear throughout Thrawn’s presence in the current canon Zahn trilogies that he himself is not cruel, and is in fact fully capable of kindness/goodness.

2) Thrawn’s allegiance to the empire was a tactical maneuver that would be long since nullified by the time of the new republic. In the first Thrawn novel, Thrawn explains that the strength of the empire (much like the strength of the prior republic) is beneficial to the Chiss in suppressing the horrors of the unknown region. There is little evidence in the Mandalorian to suggest that the fledgling remains of the empire would provide more protection/assurance than the New Republic.

3) A vengeful, malicious Thrawn is a poor end to a fantastic character’s story arc. If we treat Zahn’s novels as “Act I” for Thrawn’s arc and his appearances in Rebels as “Act II”, it is clear that we have left Thrawn in his moment of tragic hubris; defeated so humiliatingly by encounters with the force at both Atallon and Lothal, a tactician such as Thrawn would not retreat into unsavory acts of revenge, but would be inspired to delve deeper into spiritualism beyond his own understanding. 

4) Lastly, and this is admittedly my own head canon here, Thrawn would make a much better foil for Ahsoka as an ally rather than an opponent. Ahsoka’s sometimes hotheaded and impulsive ways would be quite the contrast from Thrawn’s indifferent strategizing, in a way which would mirror Thrawn’s partnership with Anakin Skywalker in the Thrawn: Alliances novel. 

All to say, boo to Thrawn being the big villain for the Mandoverse and/or the Ahsoka series.",True,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1752242,public,spoiler,,,Why Thrawn shouldn’t be the antagonist for the Ahsoka TV series,0,[],0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/l2447b/why_thrawn_shouldnt_be_the_antagonist_for_the/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But somehow, the Separatists were so fearful about the Republic sending Jedi after them for wanting to break off that they had to commission a huge droid army to defend themselves from the Republic's Jedis (and once the Republic got the clone army, the conflict escalated even more). 

While I get it that the out of universe explanation is that Lucas wanted a Space version of the American Civil War but wasn't smart enough to pull it off, I wonder what the universe explanation is.

The Republic's structure in the prequels is more akin to the EU during Brexit than to the USA during the Civil War. The UK leaving the EU is bad for the EU's economy (and for the UK's economy as well)...but it isn't a cause to go to war. 

If somehow an EU leader said *""I will not let this European Union, which has existed for decades, to be split in two""* he would be laughed at and considered as a lunatic and warmonger by other EU leaders yet Palpatine has somehow universal support amongst every single senate member? 

Surely there would be plenty of Senators that could have argued *""hey, these planets want to cut ties from the Republic and create their own trade union...why not just let them? We have way more important issues to worry about such as slavery and poverty in the Galaxy, no? Do we really want to spend money and resources in a pointless war?"".*

I really Think it would have been nice progress and Evolution to see that:
TFA : Rey couldnt fight with lightsaber.
TLJ : Rey would have attached said lightsaber to a short staff to make it as long as her original. But at this point not so elegantly. (is that a Word?)
TROS: Rey would now have time to build better mechanical continuation around the lightsaber, making it look good, with ignition button also in the lower part of the staff.

They also show only fighters and the one corvette fighting the entire final order with no capital ships in sight. So I am asking you to choose either a more reasonable/practical fleet, fewer capital ships and more starfighters or one large republic dreadnought.

You can even add in an optional story if you want to.

Really, the force is the limit.

My composition:

One Viscount-class Star defender which is the republic equivalent of the Executor but more chunky. Thanks to its abundance of Bacta tanks, repair bots and passenger count of 500,000 it will also do well in prolonged combat compared to the Xyston-Class.

20 MC80bs modified with extra Turbolasers and Ion cannons but with the tractor beams removed to make more room.

3 X-wing squadrons and 5 B-wing/E squadrons per ship. Viscount has hundreds as many fighters as well as dozens of Corellian Corvettes and Gunships thanks to its much larger hangers.

Last but not least would be the 70 venerable Assault Frigates for support, armed with more anti-starship weaponry.

These will form Republic fleets that were above Coruscant that were a little miffed that they changed capitals for no good reason as well as not acknowledging The First Order threat. Instead, the admiral of that fleet actually used his brain and prepared for a fight.

A: if you're not with me, then you're my enemy.

I love it, love the little details.

Then recently, I met the girl I'm currently dating and discovered she has a keen eye for small details; if you look at the photos in the album above, you'll see there's two lightsabers for ""Anakin/Luke Skywalker"" and ""Luke Skywalker/Anakin"" (followed by Luke's green one, not pictured).

She pointed out that the first one was destroyed and his second one is the one Luke gets. Sure enough, I looked this up and it seemed to be correct. But she wasn't 100% certain and now neither am I and It's driving me and her mad 😅

So I thought I'd ask here if this is in fact a misprint? Sorry I know this is a really silly question, but help a struggling couple out here we need closure!

If anyone has any reservations about watching it, 100% worth it. I love Clone Wars just like everyone else, but this show is something special in very different ways. Clone Wars has such great stories and character development, and man those last 4 episodes are just incredible television. But something about Rebels made me so much more emotionally invested in the entire crew of the Ghost. I cared so much more about their mission, backstories, baggage, character development etc. Which made the second half of season 4 such an emotional rollercoaster.

* Watching Ezra and Kanan grow together has been so rewarding. Ezra slowly learning and becoming more disciplined, Kanan starting off as a padawan who never finished his learning slowly becoming a jedi knight and growing himself as he imparts his knowledge onto Ezra. I particularly loved how they dealt with emotion in the show. Kanan wasn't about the old jedi order, shutting off emotion entirely, he held onto his and exemplified all the values a jedi should have but he let himself be a person too.
* Sabine's arc after she found the &gt;!darksaber!&lt; was great. She really grew more as a character after she had to confront her past at the imperial academy and complications with her family. Trials of the Darksaber was one of my personal favorite episodes.
* I haven't read anything of Thrawn in Legends but he's such a good, smart  villain in this, even if he is apparently toned down from how badass he was.
* Jedi Night broke me. Such an incredible episode. Probably the most I've cried at anything in Star Wars. &gt;!Kanan!&lt; is such an amazing character and his overally arc is done so well, now one of my favorite Star Wars characters up there with Obi-Wan and Ahsoka. From Jedi Night onwards, I would periodically tear up whenever &gt;!Kanan!&lt; was brought up.
* With all these new shows and movies announced, I'm holding out hope we see the crew of the Ghost show up again. Particularly &gt;!Ezra's!&lt; story. I will cheer so loud if we get to see him again. But if not, his final moments in the show were the perfect end to his journey in the show.
* I loved the redemption arc they gave to &gt;!Kallus!&lt;. It felt surprisingly natural after everything he'd been through with the empire. Love how it took a while to turn him into a rebel. His part in the epilogue was so sweet, speaking of
* The epilogue. So much emotion.

Would leave to hear your guys' thoughts on the show. I'm really itching to talk about it.

And then he kills Padme behind Anakin's, who has now transformed into Vader, back by using the force to draw her life energy out and transfer it to Vader in order to save his life for his own benefit but not realizing Padme had just given birth to twins who will someday be there Emperor's downfall.

So it begins with force awakens, an amazing film imo, I think it set the story for the trilogy up extremely well, and built up some amazing and interesting characters. Rey and Finns storyline was interesting to me. I loved kylo, I thought Han was dealt with correctly. Great set up for episode 8

Then came along the Last Jedi, and I have so much to say about it. I 100% comepltely loved this movie, I rank it as my third favourite Star Wars movie, I think it’s an amazing Star Wars film, and an amazing film. Other than the canto bight sequence, I genuinely think the movie is almost flawless, I loved the cinematography, I love the the lightsaber fight in the red room, I loved the way luke was handled, the fact he wasn’t a god and over powered and instead he was pathetic and old was great. It gave us a Luke we truly didn’t expect. I could go on about this film for hours, I know it’s divisive, but I truly love it.

Rise of Skywalker  
This film was pretty dissapointing, it disregarded everything that last jedi set up, however I can still enjoy it and have fun like rots, but the story was messy and rushed. It disregarded the previous to films. I didn’t mind what happened in the story, it was just to quick to justify and it didn’t make sense at times. 

Anyway, I would say I enjoyed the sequels, 2 amazing films. And one ok film. I personally believe there better than the prequels by a big margin, not as consistent as the ot, but I love them regardless.

Also feel free to just put a link to where I can find more info on a specific question (but if you do, please let me know which question). I know they are a bit loaded. I appreciate it in Advance. Now here are my questions:

1) are storm troopers recruited? Is it volunteer or forced? What age?

2) Are storm troopers trained to have no emotions, like robots? Do they ever goof around with each other? What does their training look like? Are storm troopers brainwashed, and if so, is it always effective? 

3) what does a storm trooper's helmet allow them to do (ie radar, thermal vision, etc.). Do they have a mic and speaker in their helmet so their voice isn't muffled and so their hearing isn't muffeled? Do storm troopers have a radio or walkie talky in their helmet to allow them to communicate with one another across distance? If so, what is the maximum distance they can communicate (if that limit exists)? 

4) how do storm troopers acknowledgement one another; by name or a string of numbers or what? Also, how would a Storm trooper generally address another storm trooper (ie comrade, coworker, etc.)

5) are storm troopers more individual or hive minded? Would they focus more on their own safety, their fellow soldier's safety or the empire's success at the cost of all safety? 

6) do storm troopers have to reload their guns? I've gotten mixed signals on this. If so, how long would a gun last? 

7) Do troopers often have their own personality? If not, do different types of troopers have different personalities (ie scout trooper vs sand trooper)?

8) anything else interesting about storm troopers you might want to add? Any valuable sources of storm trooper info I can look into?

I'm a canon completionist, and growing up (back in the Legends days) I had no way to properly experience stories like Knights of the Old Republic, SWTOR, Bounty Hunter, etc. I'd like to do my part to make the video-game exclusive stories accessible for those of you who are not in a position to buy a console, who don't enjoy video games but love Star Wars, or who just want to be able to include Fallen Order in a read through of canon without playing through an entire video game. 

Would anybody, anybody at all, be interested in a text adaptation of Star Wars: Fallen Order? I would model it very closely on the fan-made one that exists for the canon video game Uprising and the Jedi Lost adaptation of the audio drama - in other words, mostly just straight up transcribing it and not subjecting you to my own writing/fan fiction.

So today I decided to look up “Palpatine vs Thor” and see what it brought up. Most of it said Thor would curb stomp Palpatine, I highly disagree.  

Round 1: Lightning Abilities

A lot of things I saw said that Thor’s lightning absolutely trumps Palps, after all he destroyed ships in Infinity War with just his lightning, the reason I’m saying Palpatine is Rey (ROS) was able to demolish a First Order troop carrier with her first lightning and she wasn’t even fully Sith. If anyone say “He couldn’t kill Luke with it” first of all its Luke Skywalker he’s not going to immediately die. Second Palpatine wanted to make Luke suffer and die slow not instantly kill him. Oh and he took out single handedly the largest fleet in the whole Universe. Palpatine wins.

Round 2:

Thor doesn’t even hold a candle when it comes to speed, Palpatine could use Force speed (Like Qui-gon) and absolutely dodge every attack Thor throws at him.

Round 3: Durability 

I have to give this one to Thor, the sun thing in Infinity War was overpowered.

I love the prequel time period the most personally, I think it is the most interesting era. This show does EXACTLY what George fully wanted to do with the PT, in my opinion. Some of the great things about it:

1. The Character Development- I mean COME ON... we see what Anakin was truly like, the brother, the friend, the great person he was before he turned into Vader. Obi-Wan, with a love interest in Satine, and him really knowing of Anakin/Padme the whole time. His character is even more fleshed out. Ahsoka became one of my favorite characters. The Padawan of Anakin Skywalker. How she grows from this annoying little Padawan to a powerful, honorable person, is amazing story telling. Also giving us more of villains we love like Maul, Dooku, Grevious, and yes even Sidious (him v Maul/Savage is incredible).

2. The Clones- I love how the show makes us care for these characters even more, despite them all sharing the same DNA. Rex, Fives, Echo, Cody, and more are all fantastic clone characters and it makes Order 66 even more of a gut punch, in fact more of a gut punch than in ROTS even.

3. Tying into ROTS- ROTS is my personal favorite SW movie, and I love it even more after S7 of TCW. Everything is just more heartbreaking, seeing Ahsoka deny the idea that Anakin could be turning to the dark side. The events on Mandalore are now forever cemented into my mind while watching the film, making it that much better. And the ending of Vader on that planet, finding Ahsoka’s sabers that he built for her, is poetry on screen.

There is more that I love, but this got long.

1. The episode begins exactly how it did in The Last Jedi.
2. Much of Rey and Luke's conversation on Ach To remains the same as it did in The Last Jedi.
3. Onboard the Finalizer, General Hux and Kylo Ren (Ben Solo) receive a transmission from Coruscant, which is serving as the capital of a provisionary government by the remaining systems of the New Republic that didn't surrender to the First Order. The message is from the recently elected new chancellor. He ends his message saying ""As long as there are systems and senators, the Republic is not dead."" Hux dismisses the chancellor's words before taking orders from Kylo.
4. Fin wakes up in the Resistance medical cruiser. He is told by Po that the entire Resistance is on their way to Coruscant at the request of the chancellor. He is informed of the Provisional Republic and such. While on their way, the Resistance meets with Maz Kanata the pirate Sidon Ithano, and his crew, allowing their ship to land in the flagship's hanger. The pirates present a capsule they discovered floating in space, which is  revealed it to be a hologram projector containing a prerecorded message. It is an image of a young man who says that he if one of the students of Master Skywalker who survived Ben's massacre. He also says that he and some other survivors are living on a planet that only light side users can find via the Force. BB-8 transmits the message to the Millennium Falcon.
5. Back on Ach To, Rey still has her interactions with Ben like in The Last Jedi. After that, R2-D2 picks up the massage and shows it to Luke, Rey, and Chewbacca. Luke doesn't want to believe that some of his students are alive and that he was too consumed by grief from the massacre that he didn't bother searching for them. However, he is convinced by Rey that they should go to the planet they are on. After Luke reluctantly decides to join Rey, they set off for the planet, using the Force to find it's location.
6. Once they arrive at the planet, they are greeted by the core surviving students of Luke, consisting of the human male from the message, a male twi'lek, a male siniteen, and a female askajian. They take them to an abandoned temple where they reveal to Luke that they secretly explored the galaxy, taking in padawans of their own. They have also teamed up with Jedi who were trained under the now-dead Order 66 survivors and brought them and their padawans to the planet as well. As marveled as she is the number of Jedi, Rey begins to feel as if she is no longer needed. She ultimately has another conversation with Ben, who is curious about her current location. Ben's curiosity turns into shock when he recognizes the core survivors as former friends (who interrupt his conversation with Rey might I add) and sees how they were able to help the number of Jedi grow on the planet. In rage, Ben screams ""I killed you all! I KILLED YOU ALL!!!"" resulting in the conversation coming to an end. After a conversation, the new Jedi agree too leave with Rey, Luke, R2, and Chewie to meet with the Resistance Fleet.
7. Kylo expresses his failure to end the Jedi to Snoke and Hux with the latter briefly getting Force choked after making a snarky comment. Snoke then gives an order to follow the Falcone to the Resistance fleet.
8. The Falcone and the Jedi ship meets up with the Resistance fleet and land in the flagship's hanger. Luke and Leia share an emotional hug. Suddenly the fleet is pursued by the First Order and takes on damage like in The Last Jedi. However, a fleet of unidentified and unrecognizable ships belonging to the New Republic come to the rescue. Aside from capital ships designed to take on the Resurgence class Star Destroyers, a unique variety of starfighters are dispatched to take on Tie Fighters. They include T-85 X-Wings with a second cockpit for a rear gunner and double B-Wings resembling the Legends [Deathraven](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/5/5b/Deathraven.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130812181434). However, it still seems that the battle is in the First Orders favor. Still feeling that she is no longer needed, Rey sacrifices herself by getting into an  escape pod and launches it towards the First Order fleet allowing her to be captured while also allowing the new New Republic Fleet to escort the Resistance Fleet to Coruscant. Hux tries to order for the undamaged star destroyers to track them, but is held back by either Kylo Ren or Supreme Leader Snoke, saying that they now have Rey.
9. The two fleets arrive at Coruscant. At the senate chambers, our heroes witnesses the Chancellor bad mouth Mon Mothma for the decision to rotate the location of capital, saying that Hosnian Prime wouldn't have been destroyed had Coruscant remained the center of the galaxy. At the same time, he promises that they will fight to regain the systems the First Order stole with the help of not just the new navy, the now annexed Resistance, and the new Jedi, but also with a new army that he was secretly forming behind the senators' backs long before Hosnian Prime was destroyed. The soldiers he recruited are from systems not controlled by the Republic and the First Order. He even presents a holographic image of one of the soldiers, whos armor is based on [rejected concept art for the phase ii clone troopers armor from Revenge of the Sith.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/6/60/Concept.png/revision/latest?cb=20130227054644)
10. Onboard his star destroyer, Snoke decides that Rey will be taken to a colosseum on one of the First Order worlds where she will be publicly tortured infront of a huge crowd.
11. At the chancellor's office, a meeting is held that ends with the Jedi, Resistance, along with Sidon Ithano deciding to go save Rey, using a stolen first order cruiser usless. Luke stays behind as he still feels useless. Maz Kanata also stays behind.
12. At the First Order occupied planet, Ben tries to convince Rey to join him, but she still says no, leaving him frustrated.
13. Luke visits the Coruscant Jedi Temple, which has been fully restored after being used as Palpatine's palace. It is there that he mopes about in the restored council chamber. Maz finds him there and the they have a talk. Yoda's Force ghost appears and gives Luke the same message he gave him in The Last Jedi about failure being the greatest teacher. Yoda also reveals that he trained Maz in the ways the Force and respected her decision to not become a Jedi. After Yoda's force ghost vanishes, a representative of the chancellor enters the chamber telling Luke that the Chancellor wants to see him.
14. The Resistance, the Jedi, and the pirates successfully infiltrate the planet where Rey is to be tortured. They also find the location of the coliseum.
15. At the coliseum, Rey is publicly tortured. However, it is soon followed by a moment straight out of Attack of the Clones where the Jedi activate their lightsabers and engage in battle alongside the Resistance and the pirates, fighting against a gauntlet of First Order stormtroopers and the Knights of Ren. Finn and Po help free Rey while Captain Phasma is killed in the same manor as Jango Fett by one of the Jedi. Just as it looks like the First Order is about to win, we get another scene straight out of Attack of the Clones as the New Republic army arrives, led by Luke and Maz.
16. After leaving coliseum, Our heroes partake in a massive ground battle with the New Republic army against the First Order.
17. In a scene similar to one from attack of the clones, Luke and Rey follow Ben to the hanger where the ship is and engage him in a lightsaber fight. Luke ends up severely wounded and Rey loses an arm Maz arrives and fights Ben, but is distracted allowing for him to escape, but before having his helmet force crushed.
18. Snoke gives an order for the First Order to prepare for war with the Provisional Republic while also talking to Ben.
19. Rey is in the Medical bay where she gets a new arm. It is there she also talks with Luke about what Ben told her.
20.

When is a Jedi officially a Jedi? 

For context, it was brought up that Grogu was a Jedi during Return of the Jedi. I argued that Grogu wasn’t because a)being a Jedi was an active choice and Grogu wasn’t doing anything, but more importantly B) Grogu wasn’t knighted. 

I cited Yoda and Luke talking in RotJ, where Luke declared himself a Jedi and Yoda goes “nope, you have to confront Vader first”. I take confronting Vader as Luke’s trial so after he spared Vader and declared himself a Jedi, it was actually true ( and I just realized that upon this second declaration, he is acknowledged by Palpatine to be a Jedi). I think the phrasing here is important because it means being Jedi means being a Jedi Knight and that padawan and younglings aren’t technically Jedi, even if they were in the Jedi organization. 

The counter was that Ahsoka was called a Jedi even though she was never knighted, but my counter was that she was a Jedi by virtue of being in the organization, but those within the organization wouldn’t recognize her as a Jedi until she earned the title. 

Side note: I don’t think a knighting ceremony is necessary but basically you don’t get to call yourself a Jedi just because you can use the force and are good.

The granddaughter of one of the grandest Sith Lords, who better. It also speaks to Kylo Ren, openly telling him these things, promising him power. It thinks to itself, that Solo is to lead her there. Kylo Ren goes to Malachor, the Sith homeworld. He is followed by the resitance, by Rey. They are to have a fight to the death, fueled by the aura of hatred and venganceexuding from not only the dormant Sith Legacy, but from the planet itself. They fight, all as the legacy had forseen. To the death, to the victor goes the power. Rey has a moment. She realizes that this is the will of not the light, but of the dark. Her fighting style gradually becomes more defensive. She eventually starts talking to Ben, and they have a similar moment to the one on the Death Star's ruins. He sees a vision of his grandfather, his inspiration, his muse. All this time, he had seeked to uphold Vader's legacy, but Vader was nothing more than a construct of the Sith. He knows now, that his grandfather was not the dark lord of the sith, but the redeemed jedi. Ben Solo and Rey stop fighting.

The story takes place 2 years after The Rise of Skywalker. The remnants of the Final Order wage civil war amongst themselves as the Resistance, reinvigorated after the Battle of Exegol begins the slow process of reclaiming the galaxy. However, In the core the mysterious Grand Admiral has used a new satellite array to cut off all Hyperspace travel within the core. Rendering it impossible to attack. Within this isolated empire there is a young woman working at the Kuat drive yard who discovers that she has the force after saving a fellow worker. She is chased by the final order before being saved by an man with a red lightsaber. Together, they must work together to find an ancient artifact called the Kyber Star and prevent the final order from using it for its evil ends.

There are 6 major original characters with 1 cameo in the first film. I sadly lack names at this point, so I will just give there roles and a character I find to be a good example of what I'm going for in terms of thier characters.

The Female Lead: Aerith Gainsborough from FF7 if she was a jedi

The Male lead: Indiana Jones with a lightsaber 

The Female Supporting lead: Futaba Sakura from Persona 5

The Lead Villian: A younger Count Dooku, who still pretends to be a Jedi.

The Female Supporting Villian: Starscream from Transformers Armada

The Male Supporting Villian: Evil Poe Dameron

The one character Cameo: Hando Ohnaka


Finally, the working titles for all three films would be

Star Wars: Quest for the Kyber Star

Star Wars: Trial of Darkness

Star Wars: March of Heroes

After one of the worst years of my life, after the end of Disney Trilogy (which I see as the worst Trilogy, but feel free to enjoy it) and how it left me feeling void almost. I didn't like Mando, the supposed best Star Wars content over the last 20-40 years (depending on who you ask) since the last trilogy, I thought it was poorly done (again feel free to like it.) I for the first time wasn't excited for more Star Wars. Then, I went back to the movie that got me into it all to begin with: The Phantom Menace then I decided to marathon the original 6 movies and that brought back my love for Star Wars.

Why'd I preference my post basically saying I don't like Disney's attempt at Star Wars? Simple, it all made me remember when I loved Star Wars so much was laid out clearer than ever, it was the never ending determination of Luke, of the Rebellion and the Jedi. The movies shows what it means to be determined, just watch ESB and count how often Luke fails to do some (including the Wampa and Vader fights) and yet next film, after he's regrouped gets ready to take on Vader again this time as an actual Jedi who completed his training.

The Prequels while flawed, some movies more than others, they were exciting and built on the world around the characters, many found them boring but I like them (yes they could've been done better but that's the story of the Prequels isn't?). The action, for the most part, is amazingly done and the music is godly. 

Then I fell back into the well that is the EU, and man did I forget how much I loved Mara Jade, say what you will about the EU but you can't deny it created some great stories; KOTOR, Thrawn, The Skywalker family, 03 Clone Wars, the Prequel comics, Labyrinth of Evil etc. It all together made the universe feel completely flushed out and complete, many even make the OT and PT feel more connected on top of adding to the over all story. 

And the games oh my god! It's amazing! From the hack and slash fun of the Force Unleashed games, to Empire at War's tactical gameplay over the entire galaxy, Jedi Starfighter, X-wing and TIE Fighter's (and recently Star Wars Squadrons) putting you in those awesome ships durning intense star battles and of course 2005 Battlefront 2 which is the perfect shooter hands down, I loved it. Obviously KOTOR is one of the best RPGs of all time and it has the Empire Strikes Back of gaming as its sequel. Hopefully the dark cloud of EA has left completely and we can get more than one game everyother year and that more than half of them are good.
Ultimately I'm back into Star Wars but nothing new. Disney makes me hesitant from anything they announce as so far they haven't done seemingly anything right if you ask me. I just waiting for them to say the EU just lives in a separate timeline and let the authors continue their stories while Disney makes their own universe.

Though the some CIS oppose the Empire, some of the radical parts of their Republic rivals did support it like the Jabiim Nationalists, Maul's remaining Death Watch who used to support CIS then joining the ISC, Trandoshans, etc. The latter joined the Rebellion just to join the better Republic while the rest continued to fight for their cause.

It doesn't matter which way goes around because CIS is Sidious' creation and the Republic was there in a long time for him to infiltrate it just so he can toy around and mess everything just so it can go according to his plans. Even the Trade Federation blockade was his plan to start with to pave way towards the creation of the CIS.

Since Yoda is the Jedi Master, he is practically the figurehead leading what was leading the Republic in the long time since the days of Valorum before Sidious took over the seat unknowing of his true identity.

One can say that Yoda had the Republic in his hands from the start though he did not lead it while Sidious is the leader of CIS since day one.

Battlefront 2 (2005) proved this and no argument for one way or another.

In fact lets say Sidious is the hero of the Clone Wars and there should be those from CIS to praise him for the destruction of Republic's existence to ashes. Those who contributed should be added to being the saviors of the galaxy as well with the ranks of Tyranus, Ventress, Durge, Bane, Grievous, Jango Fett, and Alto Stratus.

The clones were Jango Fett's creation and the Jedi allowed it culminating their defeat reducing their population to approximately 90% just as how Sidious took over the Supreme Chancellor title.

Grievous countered by using the Jedi's weapons to pile up from one casualty to the masses.

Ventress, Tyranus, and the fallen Jedi are a proof that the Jedi are failures and bit them in the back proving that the Jedi are the true evil.

Durge existed in a long time and wants to taste the thirst of creating a graveyard of infinite number of Jedi, Mandalorian, and clones to check off his bucket list to get paid. It all started when the Mandalorians ruined his life and the Jedi were too stupid to allow the clones to become the army in the first place giving Durge the chance to come from the curtains in a century to drop more blood than ever.

Bane like Durge wants fame and not much is known about him other than his personal vendetta against Jango Fett drawing him into mass murdering clones as much as possible to his lust for battle.

Say all you want but in the minds of CIS, they won the Clone Wars not the Republic from their point of view even though it seems like the Republic won the war but their existence was cut short into transforming into the Empire destroying everything including their very cause and ideals they have fought for.

In the Old Republic days, Sith have pretty much won since Bane's plan was brought to reality that the dark side would continue to seize hold of the galaxy for years to come from the collapse of the Republic and Jedi to another regardless of their victories. Even the Mandalorians are proven to sought out Republic's messed up ideology that allowed the Jedi to face their flaws. Their division are one to consider since one wants to fight, the latter to be honorable warriors, and the recent to bring peace that rise the likes of Revan, Durge, etc.

Rebel Alliance stayed true to their ideals into their transformation to the New Republic and therefore won the Galactic Civil War, not the Empire who suffered defeats from the loss of Palpatine, Thrawn, and so on to split into Imperial Remnants before rebuilding themselves to become Fel and Krayt's Empire.

TL:DR at the bottom.

So, for a few years now I’ve been running a few minecraft servers. I love making them and running them, it’s a way for me to put my creativity into something. 

I am a massive Star wars fan, and I have recently been spending a lot of time playing games like, fallen order, old republic and the force unleashed 2. And suddenly it just clicked, what if I made a star wars themed Minecraft server? 

I have a lot of experience with this and i’m sure I could create something people would genuinly enjoy. However, I am not sure how this would align with copyright?

Basically, the server would be completelly free to play, I would earn 0 dollars on this. I do this out of passion, and all my servers have always been free to play. It would take place in an alternative timeline, before the old republic (in legends). This is to allow players to be able to create their own story. And as a result, I would not be using anything from the starwars brand, apart from names of planets, stuff like holocron, lightsaber, darksaber, and so on. 

Would this be legal? The server would also have an application, so it wouldn’t be 100% public, you’d need to be accepted.

# To Hear Him Tell It: Our D6 odyssey continues with a Toydarian Criminal Mastermind...Maybe?

📷

Welcome to Jackedup Tales of the Fringe; where I tell the tales of a fledgling GM, a few discarded D6 sourcebooks and a pack of preteens.

If you want to know more or begin at the beginning, pop the link at the bottom. But today's episode is about the first character of this haphazard group. Qudar; who is Toydarian would-be criminal mastermind. It has to be read to be believed because 'To Hear Him Tell it'..well, just read along!

**cancelled projects**: Star Wars 1313, his spinoff movie

**brought back from the dead**: in legends and now in canon (like Darth Maul and others)

**relatively short screen time**: most people love him because of his expanded universe books/comics (like Quinlan Vos and others)

**that thing when a character is introduced as something and then every member of his/her race is the same**: Boba Fett was a warrior with a cool armor, so every mandalorian is a warrior with a cool armor(like how every hutt is a crime lord like Jabba)

More importantly the internals of ships.  

IRL currently in outerspace we have not developed gravity generators for space stations or shuttles so our astronauts just kinda float around.  

However, in SW we can clearly see that is not the case.  However, my question is at what point do ships shut off their internal gravity generators?  In Episode III on Grievous ship at one point it is disabled and starts to fall to the planet causing the ship and its ""floor"" to change according to its orientation to the planets surface.  And in Episode VII when they are escaping Jaku BB-8 is at the will of the planets gravity, even so much to having to suspend himself via cables to keep from falling everywhere.  And in BF2's campaign when the Corvus is hit in the final mission and turned on its side the hanger is dumped on the planets surface. 

But in other instances we see large starships, shuttles, and some times much larger capital class ships, rapidly change their direction on the Y-axis or roll, or perform other maneuvers and internally the occupants are showing no effect of the maneuver 90% of the time they dont even wear restraints to keep them in their seats.  

So I'm just confused.  Do internal gravity generators shut off at a certain point, or are they so weak compared to natural gravity that when in a planets full gravitational field they are rendered useless?",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1749725,public,self,,,Ships and Gravity,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/l0xjxz/ships_and_gravity/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is a strange place actually, there are we, a bunch of stormtroopers, fleet admirals (among other ranks) and even the Emperor or Vader himself. What we do here is ""fight Rebel scum"". Let me explain this Better: 
Once you enter the discord the Emperor will ask for a codename and TK number, like in Star Wars. Well, then you will have to choose either the army or navy. And after  you have done this you are ready to go blow up some Rebel troops. These fights work based on improvisation we ""built"" it out from the chat, there is no videogame stuff or screen, you imagine yourself among other troopers and just, improvise, do whatever you want!! Its similar in some ways to a role play... it would be cool if you joined us!! 

""Long live to the empire""

Ezra gets more and more egoistic each episodes, doesn't use his jedi powers like he forgot about them apart from using his light saber and I'm waiting for a character development or any plot twist or change since he kept the Sith Holocron.
From this moment I'm just pissed ever episode and for me he's not part of the team or important to anything in the story.

It might change but so far I'm just disappointed and he raises my stress level to a point where I actually want to stop watching lmao.

Well I thought that the series could be about Obi-Wan learning how to be one with the force after death, like the Yoda arc in TCW S6. It would make sense as to why it's a one season series, why Liam Neeson could be in it as Qui-Gon and why Hayden Christensen would play Vader in a ""rematch"" which wouldnt harm the OT.

Yoda or Qui-Gon could talk to Obi-Wan through the force and tell him to go to Dagobah or that planet that Yoda went to with R2. Maybe we could even see Mortis again. If Obi-Wan takes the trial he would see illusions like Qui-Gon, Satine, Ahsoka, ANAKIN that would test him.

This is where I think Hayden Christensen really could come into play. When Obi-Wan has to go to Moraband, Sidious can make him fight Anakin and at some point maybe Sidious goes to kill Anakin and Obi-Wan ""sacrifices"" himself instead, passing the test. And I mean Anakin without the Vader suit, just regular Anakin. They could also change it up and make Maul ""kill"" Anakin.

Chapter 1

The cantina was dark and smokey, the smell of alcohol and music wafted through the room.The lowest life forms in the galaxy were all gathered in the loud, sweaty bar. Assassins, dealers, and crooks all gathered to drink away the day and look out for their next score. Darth Starrus shuffled through the riff raff and scum trying to get toward the main meeting hall. His thick tan robe covered his mouth and hid his eyes from anyone who might try to get a glance at them, such precautions were necessary. If anyone saw his bright yellow eyes they’d know  immediately, he was a Sith. Several aliens of various species tried to get close, each hoping to score a few credits or a weapon. Starrus sensed all of them, all of their intentions and greed. He gently nudged them away with the force, bending their weak and desperate mind to his own overpowering will. 


“You don't want to rob me, you want to clear a path and let me pass,” he murmured while willing the darkside to do his bidding. 


The room became silent as everyone slowly moved out of his way and closer to the bar as Starrus passed through the massive golden doors guarded by Gamorian pigs, hulking brutes with no brains and plenty of brawn. They grunted toward Starrus and moved forward drawing their vibro axes, but Starrus waved them aside with the same manipulation as the other scum. The meeting room was adorned with gold and jewels everywhere. All types of creatures and bounty hunters were sitting at a massive gold table, surrounded with drinks, hookah, and many Twi’eleck serving girls all scantily clad. At the end of the table was a large stone stage on top of which sat Orra the Hutt. 


“Orra is supposed to be a small Hutt, at least by Hutt standards,” thought Starrus. 


Orra was easily eight feet tall and at least as long, with thick rolls of fat covering her serpentine body.


“At least the records say it’s a she,” Starrus thought, eyeing the grotesque creature. “It’s so damn hard to tell with Hutts.”


As he walked in Starrus could feel all eyes on him, he also sensed at least a few of the seated bounty hunters drawing weapons under the table.

 Orra gestured at Starrus and then spoke a warbled language that used spitting to communicate. 

“Speak what you wish of Orra, glorious Hutt mistress.” lisped a wizened old translator on the corner of the stage. 


Starrus bowed deeply, nearly touching the floor. 


“Mistress Orra, your humble servant requests passage through your spice routes.” said Starrus.


 He knew it was always best to act lowely before a Hutt to play to their ego. He did his best to swallow his disgust at the creature, aside from her repulsive form, she also kept pets to attend to her on the stage. Animals and humanoids alike were kept in cages or chains until called upon by the Hutt to “entertain” her. 


“Your servant brings you a tribute for service,” he bowed again, pulling a stack of credits out of the pocket of his robe. 


Orra gestured him forward and Starrus placed the credits in front of her on the stage. The old crone counted out the credits in Orra’s native tongue and Orra sneered with her beedy yellow eyes until the count hit several thousand.


“Orra accepts your tribute, you are free to travel safely through the Huttian routes.” 


Starrus bowed again and slowly made off to exit the room.


“Well that wasn’t so difficult,” he thought, exhaling deeply. 


He could sense the bounty hunters put away their weapons as their attention was drawn to the next of Orras pets. It would have been so easy for him to slip away from the cantina and continue safely on his mission but something caught his attention on the stage. A few of the Gamorian guards opened one of the cages and dragged out a human with long dark hair and pale skin, she had cuts and bruises all over her body, which was barely covered by a tattered piece of cloth. This was a common event amongst the Hutt race, the creatures loved to sadistically torture prisoners their bounty hunters had captured for them. Darth Starrus felt no need to get involved in the Hutts' matters, after all he had gotten what he wanted and only needed to walk out of the room. But suddenly the girl caught his eyes with hers from across the room, they were a piercing dark blue and made him feel her presence. He could feel her subconsciously using the force to make him feel her anguish, a desperate plea for help. Starrus had taken countless lives since he fell to the darkside of the force and never once felt pity, after all it wasn’t the Sith way. Nonetheless something about this girl made him step back up to the stage.


“Mistress Orra, please allow me to purchase this slave of yours. I can offer you double what I paid for my passage.” 


The Hutt bellowed, first in laughter and then in anger.


“The mistress warns you to leave her presence with your obnoxious requests,” explained the translator.


“Mistress, I cannot leave without that slave,” said the Sith lord calmly. 


The force warned him as every bounty hunter drew weapons and slowly got up from their seat. The Hutt pulled the girl closer to her by a chain around her neck, drawing a small scream from her lips.


In an instant Starrus had his double bladed lightsaber drawn and flipped through the air, cutting the chain. Blaster fire filled the room as Starrus deflected every shot back at the sender with his crimson blades. He used his heightened reflexes to jump from the stage to the table while cutting down a bulbous eyed Rodian bounty hunter. He could feel the familiar thrum of rage and pain course through his blood, the darkside of the force making him feel strong...powerful. He channeled all the rage and hate and blasted it out of his hands as powerful waves of lightning, corpses hit the floor with their eyes burned and skin blackned. 


“Don't move Jediie,” hissed the Hutt in broken common. Her tail was wrapped around the neck of the girl and was slowly choking the life out of her. 

Starrus cast off his robe and allowed his long dark hair and red eyes to be revealed. He raised one black gloved fist and used the force to crush the Hutt’s tail to a useless lump. The Hutt’s screams were cut short as he crushed her windpipe with force channeled from his other fist.


“One problem, mistress,” He hissed back.

 “I’m no Jedi, I’m the one true Sith lord.

Not the best strategic choice, now is it?

Force ghost Obi-Wan has the most unexplained, convenient timing for the story to work in that exact way. A day sooner, a day later-completely different story.

Remember when Obi-Wan described imperial stormtroopers as ""so precise""? Because this movie doesn't. There's a youtube video proving that their shots hit the targets less than 1% of the time (At least in ANH they had a reason to let the Falcon crew go)

&amp;#x200B;

Why didn't Vader grab the Falcon with the force as it was lifting off from Hoth?

&amp;#x200B;

Why didn't Han pay off his debt to Jabba in between films? Just lightspeed there for a sec and rejoin the rebellion soon after, why keep delaying it after the incident with Greedo?

&amp;#x200B;

The asteroid field is not only pointless, but the characters survive a situation that there's a chances of 3,720 to 1 to survive in just because Han doesn't care about that.

&amp;#x200B;

AT-AT armor is too strong for blasters... until it falls? And if you need to hit an (unestablished) weak spot why not do it while the walker is very slowly, well... walking?

&amp;#x200B;

AT-AT ""too strong for blasters"" armor not being used on death star exhaust ports and TIE-Fighters (no weight in space)

&amp;#x200B;

The empire not sending a spy with a visual means of communication for Vader to force choke the rebel leaders.

&amp;#x200B;

Where was this giant armada of star destroyers, each with it's own TIE-Fighters, during the climax of the last film? Yes, Tarkin was cocky, but Vader remained in that area and could have called for reinforcements while the rebels were chilling on Yavin.

&amp;#x200B;

Leia casually goes from kissing Luke (twice) (yuck) to in a way cheating on Luke with Han, she doesn't even even take a moment to feel guilty about it.

&amp;#x200B;

The last film established the empire as ""vulnerable"" without the death star and only ""in control"" with it, so why is it a dark time for the rebellion who casually celebrated after blowing it up?

&amp;#x200B;

Yoda observes Luke as someone who ""always with him what cannot be done"" after he rescued the princess from the death star and blew it the hell up.

&amp;#x200B;

The entire battle of Hoth-the galaxy ruling empire added those AT-AT legs and binding the turrets to the movement of the entire head for no reason instead of an actual practical way to move through the snow that probably won't be that slow both mobility and aiming wise.

&amp;#x200B;

On the asteroid-Why do Han and Leia not need space suits for the asteroid?

&amp;#x200B;

The whole entire empire can't capture one ship, in a worse condition from when they captured it last time...

&amp;#x200B;

Han and Leia's entire romance sub plot-Leia's out of character kiss for Luke mere minutes after Han gets frozen, undermines all of it. And no comforting Luke that way instead of a hug or a kiss on the cheek is not an excuse.

&amp;#x200B;

The empire catching Solo's crew-why doesn't Vader try to get information about Luke's whereabouts as he's torturing Han? This wouldn't have been as big of a deal were we not shown Han hearing Luke repeating the words ""Dagobah"" after Han finds his frozen body, and Luke would realistically tell his friends where he was gonna go anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Luke training with Yoda-A) makes the force seem so utterly limitless with ""size matters not"", ""only different in your mind"", ""lack of belief is why you fail"", etc... that you gotta wonder why this type of logic isn't used to easily win mass scale fights by pushing and pulling craft of all sizes to crash into one another if not straight up pull them apart... also why didn't ghost Obi-Wan listened in on Vader's plans to send a probe droid to the hoth system and inform the rebellion way earlier?

B) Why is Yoda chilling here, and not an ally to the rebellion? Worst case scenario, he could still train Luke as a force ghost.

Luke leaving training: A) Why didn't Yoda, after proving that ""the force is his ally-and a powerful ally it is"" come to help his 2nd to last hope against Vader? Like worst case scenario he could train Leia as a force ghost alongside Obi (and yes I know Return had him go ""old and weak have I become"" but that contradicts his ""I'm powerful AF"" moment with the line and lifting the X-Wing and everything, it doesn't justify it)

B) Both Obi-Wan and Yoda leaving the ""father"" reveal for Vader to use as an obvious power move to turn Luke to the dark side-and no his ""unexpected, this is"" in Return of the Jedi doesn't explain it and if anything contradicts his wise status

&amp;#x200B;

Boba and the empire ambushing the gaang on Bespin-how exactly did Boba go from being hidden BEHIND Han, to being in Cloud City with the empire without even making anyone suspect anything (except Leia with Lando himself, but that's a different aspect of it)? How could he have possibly known where they were going before their arrival to the planet, assuming that's the defense for this complaint? Did he and the entire Empire smoothly lightspeed straight into Lando's office to get ahead of the fastest ship in the galaxy without ace pilot Han Solo noticing even though a jump that specific was established as deadly in the last film, some-freaking-how?

&amp;#x200B;

Luke losing against Vader-shouldn't have happened if Luke would have properly stroke Vader's neck which was where he was aiming but it was changed in editing to be his shoulder POST hit (Luke was aiming for Vader's neck in an attempted horizontal slice but the movie pretends like it hits the side of his shoulder)

&amp;#x200B;

Luke and the gang escaping cloud city-shouldn't have happened, both because Vader could have force grabbed him as he was falling from the chamber and if Vader wouldn't have uncharacteristically half-assed it by ordering Piett to ONLY turn off 1 switch when they could have done so much more-like why not cause permanent damage to it, things that make the Falcon be able to fly in the first place (like the engine) or just destroy the Falcon entirely while you're already at it? If the empire wanted to keep it, then why not order some stormtroopers/cloud city pilots to take off with it immediately? There is no reason for the empire to be content with just disabling the Falcon's hyperdrive.

Reminder-these are the kind of guys to blow up a planet just for a weapon's DEMONSTRATION.

How did the emperor figure out Luke was Vader's son?

And the worst offender, the entire space chase which massively affects both plotlines and what causes their intersection because it's there to essentially buy time for Luke to train so that he could reject the dark side by the end of the movie-the empire had a tractor beam the entire time as confirmed in the movie's end but chose not to grab it even when it was flying right towards 2 destroyers upon leaving Hoth, for example (and that's assuming they can't grab them during all the other times when they were right behind it, in the last movie they grabbed them while being much farther away and that was in a fully functioning version of the Falcon and flying backwards as an attempt to negate it didn't help even back then) instead opting to shoot deadly lasers at it while simoulentiously wanting its crew in 1 piece.

If they caught them right after Hoth or even a little later then Luke wouldn't have had little to no training with Yoda before playing into Vader's hands, the leader of the rebels would have been caught and turned alongside the princess and general Solo, no more Jedi, story over-and this is just the worst example. Most of my other ones break the story as well.

So here it is:

The Rey force pull scene in TFA. It’s obviously a legendary moment in the sequels and iconic in Star Wars in general but someone suggested someone else be the one to pull that lightsaber out of the snow: Luke Skywalker himself.

At first I was like what? Just knowing how the other movies turn out but then I thought about it and maybe it could’ve actually worked. Here’s why:

1.) A big complaint was Rey being too powerful from the jump and while I disagree I still wouldn’t have minded an alternative of seeing more training with her before she took on a saber duel. 

2.) it works for the moment. Rey got knocked out, Finn got sliced, Luke steps in to save both of them. Maybe Luke sensed Rey like with Grogu. The only problem would be the meaningless map to Luke Skywalker that was in the plot of the movie, but they’ve explained away bigger things *cough* somehow Palpatine has returned *cough*

3.) it allows for some time in between 7 and 8. This is probably the most important point here. Time in between Star Wars films really helps in my opinion. It allows for certain off screen growth and development in our characters that we don’t have to waste time showing in an important episodic film. Instead of needing to see what happens directly after 7, we can jump in at a later date, and put the pieces together ourselves instead of having to explain every little thing. 

4.) at this point I’m realizing some people may think it might hurt Luke’s character arc in episode 8. You know? Like why would luke help if he felt the way he did in 8? Well for one I think it would reinforce the idea that Luke isn’t all pessimistic hermit, that there is still some of that rebellious hope in him. And I actually think Rian Johnson was going for something along those lines anyway. Like yeah, Luke was pretty messed up at the start of 8, but he still cared about his friends and family and what he used to be. So maybe him saving Rey could’ve been a “yeah I’m still a good guy and I’ll help my friends, but I won’t do it as a Jedi” kind of like Ahsoka in the siege of mandalore.

5. All of this could allow a deeper explanation for Kylo and Luke’s relationship and what happened with the Jedi temple destruction. Less stitching 7 and 8 together could’ve given time for more insight to the vision Luke saw in Kylo’s sleep or maybe even dialogue between Luke and Kylo during their duel on Starkiller base that made Luke’s actions feel more understandable. 

All of this and we would’ve saw Jedi master Luke Skywalker in action in a full fledged saber fight with kylo ren. What we got was still great in my opinion, but man that could’ve been cool too.

Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE the prequels, but there’s a HUGE aesthetic difference between Phantom Menace &amp; the latter two films. And I’m not sure it’s just related to the digital cinematography. 

Phantom Menace looks &amp; feels like a big expensive movie. Amazing sets, huge action set pieces, amazing make up &amp; costumes. The reported budget was around 115 million. Most of the interior sets for Episode 1 were filmed in England.

Episode 2 &amp; 3, and especially 3, feel much less grand. Almost...cheap. The sets(like the Coruscant apartment interior) feel like they are made out of plastic. There’s very little actual location work. Everything but the CGI feels almost like a TV set. Even the hair &amp; make up(non prosthetic) looks cheap. Anakin’s black leather costume in episode looks like something I could buy off of Amazon. The reported budgets are almost the same as episode 1. Attack of the Clones cost 120 million compared to Revenge of the Sith’s 110 million. Instead of filming primarily in England, episode 2 &amp; 3 were shot in Australia. 

Look at all the amazing costume work in episode 1! The queens wardrobe alone should’ve won an Oscar. Yet episode 2 &amp; especially 3, every has this cheap “faux” plasticy feel to it. 

What’s interesting about the budgets of the prequels is that they are relatively low considered the spectacle &amp; production value. I’m not sure if this is because George owned ILM &amp; could get the VFX work done without mark up or what. But when you look at other film budgets of that era &amp; what those films were able to achieve compared with the Star Wars prequels, it’s clear that George was able to get more bang for his buck.

I think maybe the issue might be a combination of things. As mentioned on Episode 1 they used actual film, shot on location but they also used minimal digital set extensions. Episode 2 &amp; especially 3 have quite a lot of sets that are 100% digital(think of the Jedi Temple hallways).

Again, I love the prequels. But I wish George had kept the films looking &amp; feeling more like Episode 1.

Because we could get the good ass show not tell acting and the show and not tell writing we get from  them. That would fix the 2 BIGGEST problems with of the prequels.
          
            Now ik that obisiden is a game company and and alot are probably not great with film but i fell a writing team form them for the trilogy would be really easy because you are writing something that is meant to be 7 and a half hours long and kotor 2 was over 20 i think. They wouldn't have to stretch out the plot at all. 
 
            Idk know if Stephen Spielberg is a star wars fan but if he is then lets go. After seeing Schindler's list i have seen what this man can do when he has a clear idea about how to go about a movie and the acting is what star wars needs. Ik that movie is based of a ture story but back to the future was filled with the show dont tell directing we need.

            I my opinion this what star wars should get to rival the og trilogy. But im fine with not ever get this is just an idea not a prediction. I really think we didnt need a squeal trilogy and the movies are not bad flims as everyone says they are, but the creative limits are depressing  because we know the 1st ideas for this trilogy were cool as fuck but they decided to  play there cards safe because of the prequels leaving a bad taste in everyone's mouth and also Disney has NEVER been good at world build like George was.

When most fans think of Luke, they mostly think of him in ROTJ; he is calm, mostly kind, though, willing to fight for his friends and for the better part of the galaxy. When Mandalorian Season 2 wrapped up, people saw the Luke they were wanting to see for years, but I've always had a problem with that version of Luke. 

This might stem from my distaste for the prequels, but ROTJ Luke was a monotone, boring, character. I remember rewatching Episode 6 a couple of months ago, and I kept joking, ""Is Luke okay? He's not acting like himself,"" because his whole character was almost braindead or borderline depressed.

As an example. Oh, hey, there is a party with a bunch of Ewoks (as much as I hate them). Everyone is smiling and having a good time, but we see Luke standing in the background with a stern look on his face.

He just didn't act like himself.

I understand that Luke has seen a lot during the war, and it probably left him a bit blank because of character development (also perhaps acting more like Darth, conflicted on turning evil or not). He changed from a whiny brat to a serious torn adult, but from my entertainment standpoint, that isn't an engaging character for me to watch.

I prefer the ANH and Empire versions where he was whiny, slightly cocky, and wanting to make bold decisions instead of using his head. He was daring -- he wanted adventure, but those things would be his undoing sometimes. 

When I think of the ROTJ Luke incarnation, I just see him staring at the camera sternly. Walks away from happy moments. Stares off into space. Speaks in a monotone, dead voice. That isn't exciting for the main character of the story.  

This will be controversial (and filled with downvotes), but most of this probably stems from the prequels. This was when Lucas was starting to make the Jedi a bunch of monotone flunkies. When I heard Old Ben's vague tales of a **Jedi Knight**, I didn't think that those groups of people were forbidden to feel emotions or things like that. I saw them as normal people who followed the Force.

Though, I guess those vague descriptions would allow Lucas to make up anything he wanted down the line because we got the prequel Jedi. More Monk than Knight. 

Either way, though, Luke did feel anger down toward the end, but all of these things weren't enough for me. This thing is just one of many that made ROTJ bad for me. Sure, it could've been made to show Luke is growing **darker** and outright choking guards in some scenes, but that Luke just wasn't interesting enough.

This, for me, gets even worse when we see Luke not conflicted at all. In Battlefront II or Mando, Luke is just completely monotone. He has kind words, but there is no character to Luke. He is just a brainwashed Jedi Monk wanting to either brainwash a young alien or convince some Imperial to join his side. 

I'm not saying the other versions of Luke were amazing, but I felt that Luke acted more like a human instead of a robot during ANH and Empire. What do you think? Perhaps it helps the story? Showing how the Jedi Order has taken all character from Skywalker? This is a rushed post, but I was just wondering what the community thought.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1747876,public,self,,,Does anyone else not like Luke too much in ROTJ?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/l044tz/does_anyone_else_not_like_luke_too_much_in_rotj/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m kinda just starting to realize what’s going on with the Mandalorian, and other shows. I see all the theories that the sequels are becoming uncanon, or moving to a different timeline. I don’t believe either of those to be the case, and if they are true, I won’t believe it till I see it.

Right now, I believe Filoni and Favreau are worldbuilding for the sequels. With the Ahsoka show, the Mandalorian, and rangers of the new republic, they are going to give us an insight into what was going after the fall of the empire and before the rise of the first order. 

Outside of some of the more well known issues people have with the sequels, I really hate the lack of world building. When I watched the sequels, I didn’t know what happened. How did the first order come to be? Where did Kylo Ren come from? How was Luke’s new jedi order? Where is the new republic? Some of these questions were answered in comics (Kylo Ren), but cmon, that’s cash cowing at its finest.

The prequels also had some world building aspect. The Clone Wars made the prequels so much better because it gave Anakin a much bigger story. IMO, that vastly improved the prequels. The sequels are very unliked by the Star Wars fandom, and rn they are working to fix that. Do I think the narrative will shift as much as it did with the prequels? No. Will the sequels remain largely unliked for awhile? Yes.

Now it wasn't until I got to Reddit when I found that Star Wars fans hate this trilogy. I was enraged!!! These movies are great!!!!

And even tho I would like to see this aspect of the story a bit different too, I kept the Sith wayfinder thingys to guide people to Exegol. But after Rey fought Kylo / Ben, and she took tried finding the wayfinder. She starts hesitating and becomes unsure and concerned about the great task she now has on her shoulders. To kill Palpetine. So one final time she tried to communicate with the force ghosts of the past Jedi, hoping that in this moment where she needs their advice the most. They would show up. And of course... they did. And not just 1 or 2 Jedi show up. But all Jedi masters come to her aid. Mace Windu tells her that the faith of all Jedi lies in her hands now. Luke convinces her that their training was enough and that if she was brave enough she could defeat the emperor. Yoda would probably say something like : Hmh hmmm, a strong Jedi Knight you have become Rey. But do let the dark side in you take over you must not. Obi One tells her that if she would let that happen she would end up to be just like the padawan he once had ( Anakin ) and that she would end up just like Kylo. As an assistant to Palpetine. Anakin tells her that if she completes this mission successfully unlike him, she would be granted the rank of Jedi master. So that she could start finding and training a new generation of Jedi. [ Time goes on Rey goes to confront Palps and of course good Kylo shows up to come help her out a bit. ] But after that it seemed like even with Kylo and Reys’ powers together Palpetine ended up being too powerful. So then we get the iconic lines : I am all the Sith, and I am all the Jedi. But I felt like you know what just those 2 cringy lines could be a bit cooler too. So begin Palpetine we’ll add force ghosts of all Sith and behind Rey force ghosts of all Jedi. Kind of an epic staredown happens with Rey deflecting Palpetines’ lightning with her lightsabers just like in the movie. And then Palps dies just as in the movie. After that, the Jedi ghosts came one last time to visit Rey. And Windu made Rey a Jedi master. After that, Rey looks up and slowly sees Ben Solo slowly appearing as a force ghost too. In Jedi robes, a Ben Solo like we have never really seen before. He doesn’t say anything he just kinda nods his head down to Rey. And Rey of course does this back. Then Yoda says : Rey, successfully fulfilled your mission you have. Now, let the force guide you, you must. And find good students for you to train. Then Qui-Gon starts the classic final line : And Rey, may the force be with you....... Now for the rest the movie just kinda ends the same way as the original did.

1. Why send one ship as a “demonstration” before the fleet is launched!? Palp’s my man, you had it. You listened to Thrawn and Tarkin. You had a virtually unstoppable fleet, each ship with the power to end life on a planet, and enough of them to maintain order. Your show of force is popping all of them in front of populated planets and ending a few that exist, or blasting one of their moons. People will get the message and you don’t have to worry about the entire galaxy sending people in some last ditch effort to stop you (which is now the third time that’s happened to you, fourth for vaguely Imperial forces. Learn. Your. Lesson.)

2. Why are you not commanding the entirety of the First Order to protect the fleet while it launches. Again, you have a nigh unstoppable fleet once it’s launched. If you get it up, that’s it, game over, you win. The first order could abandon the galaxy for a week to defend this new fleet and come back triumphant. 

3. I know I’ve said the fleet is unstoppable (and it basically is), but you like everyone should know fighters just pass through shields (it’s dumb but true). Why are your planet killers literally fodder to a few torpedos? Put some armor or ray shields or something over the glass that is your glass cannon on each of these.

So when I saw episode 9 I interpreted Palpy’s “Kill me, and my spirit will pass into you, as all the Sith live in me. You will be empress... we will be one.” As a figurative thing. I thought he was just saying she’d carry on his legacy. 

A week later I saw it a second time &amp; thought maybe it was more of a mystical thing where part of the Sith master’s power or knowledge or something is transferred into their apprentice by evil magic or whatever. It seemed very sudden to introduce that concept but I know the Abrams version of the movie was made in a furious rush after Colin Trevorrow was fired. 

I’m about to rewatch it again for my friend’s podcast &amp; it seems like most people’s interpretation is that Palpatine’s going to take over Rey’s body. Like my second interpretation, it seems like that might be what he’s saying but it’s kind of a sudden left turn at the end of a nine movie series. 

Do the novelizations/making of/visual dictionary say anything that clarifies or elaborates on what’s really happening in that moment? Or do any interviews or behind the scenes material give us a hint towards the creators’ intent? 

TLDR: I’m confused by what exactly Palpatine means when he says his spirit will pass into Rey &amp; want to know what the background material &amp; the filmmakers have to say about jt.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1746760,public,self,,,What do the books say about Palpatine’s “my spirit will pass into you” line?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kzrfop/what_do_the_books_say_about_palpatines_my_spirit/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I just started watching Rebels  a while back and we get to the episode ""The Mystery of Chopper Base"". It starts off good, we meet Dicer, and I was getting excited for a named secondary soldier like 5s, echo, Heavy, Tup, Dogma, Crosshair, Slick, Crys, Waxer, Boil, etc. and it didn't happen. They could easily have had named side characters like this. If they wanted to show how deadly a pilot or enemy is, kill off one of these characters, instead of, ""this is Phoenix 3 . . . AAAAAAAAHHHHHH, (explosion)."" They can have a story and not be crucial to the main plot. Instead of having all of the Phoenix pilots die whenever they get into combat, they could have had the aces surviving through the worst odds fighting with Hera through thick and thin and then they die off slowly throughout the story. Just having them be reoccurring characters can endear the audience to them, take for instance Hando Ohnaka. I mean he serves no real purpose in the story other than someone they constantly interact with (Yes i'm including the clone Wars in this assessment) and he's one of the best side characters in Star Wars.

It just rubs me the wrong way that they go to save this character and, unlike all of the other characters they try to help, they just write her off. Those cruel heartless bastards! what happened to helping people regardless of the cost? We're told our main characters care for people but they run through pilots and ships carelessly throwing them at problems (like the blockade, concord dawn, Darth Vader, etc.) Also since we learn the threat isn't a threat later does that mean she's just hanging somewhere hopefully waiting to be rescued and it never comes? Then she finally realizes how much they just don't care for her, how to them she's just another faceless soldier another number on a list

Fully expect this post to get down voted into the basement, but I really think it would make a massive difference to the pacing, and how some of the crucial story elements were hastily explained, not to mention how the part of the fandom that's less than happy would experience this movie. 

Is there hope? Let's start with the facts. We know there is a 3 hour and 8 min cut. How do I know? Well, the chief editor, MaryAnn Branson, said so in an interview. I think this is something they worked on, that made narrative sense, and my feeling is that they felt it was too long from a commercial perspective, as opposed to an artistic. It would seem to me that in between the 142 min we got, and the 188 min they started from, there is, with some goodwill from Disney, a great extended edition waiting to be released. We also know that John Williams originally produced 135 minutes of score, which indicates a considerably longer movie than 142 minutes we got if we compare his score length compared to previous movies. According to co-writer Chris Terrio, it was initially such an extensive scope that it was even proposed to split the film in two parts. 

A longer version could make such a massive difference. We know that they filmed Hux and co being involved in the initial attack on Mustafar, Kylo Ren met with the webish gob, Rey was using to the Jedi script in order to work on her lightsaber, and a long intro on Palpatine's cloning was cut as it was felt it detracted, and the list goes on. 

I personally think most of our problems doesn't come from a creative rut or retconning between directors, but from the Disney running out of time after the axed Trevorrow development. I think TROS is way better than the more vocal fandom gives it credit, but I have to agree that both TFA and TLJ had a different level of story telling (good or bad), and that it was undoubtedly a mistake to push it out at all cost instead of giving JJ the time he needed. 

In the aftermath perhaps an Extended Edition or Director’s Cut was, and has been, the plan from Disney all along. Something to fill the gap until the next movie or to spice up Disney+? It is certainly odd that we haven't seen any director's commentary, and not a single deleted scene yet. Could it be that these deleted scenes are being saved for a reason?

Each AI is slightly different and varies greatly based on the type of droid. Astromechs tend to be more curious while Protocol Droids are cautious. B-1 Battle Droids are slower while Tactical Droids are calculated. Nevertheless, no one questions their societal rank. They are everywhere in the galaxy but receive no personal rights of their own. They are completely enslaved by everyone. Not just the Separatists or the Empire. But also the Jedi Order and the Rebellion. Everyday citizens use droids. Jawas make huge profits from trafficking lost droids. It is not as though they don't make decisions or think on their own. R3-S6 turned against the Jedi. R2 routinely makes his own snarky comments and loves to get a rise out of C-3PO. Plus, R2 commonly makes sad sounds every time Anakin leaves him. IG-11 was fully capable of reason when dealing with the Mandalorian. K-2SO had was easily one of the most human droids in *Star Wars*, having a penchant for annoyance and sarcasm. There was even a B-1 Battle Droid that deserted the Separatist Army. Let's not forget Professor Huayang who is widely considered as just another Jedi Master among the Jedi Order due to his extensive knowledge of Lightsabers, Kyber, and the Force.

However, taking the forgotten cannon into account (or legends) couldn't Vader use lighting. Just as a jedi can use their hand for force push and pull but doesn't need to, couldn't Vader use his mind to create force lighting without it coming from his hand or even his body at all. Hypothetically Vader could use lighting by conjuring it without it coming close to his body.

My only reasoning I can see for him not using it would be two reasons. 1 it is extremely difficult to conjur lighting without using your arm and the effectiveness isn't worth the amount of concentration. 2 it is erratic and not entirely controllable therefore the risk of it accidentally hitting his suit and killing him is not worth it even though he can use the ability.

In Revenge of the Sith, Padme tells us that the Republic falls with a round of applause, and certainly that's true, but the round of applause that changed the Republic for the Empire happened long before that scene.

In Attack of the Clones, we can see the power and might of the new Grand Army of the Republic, but, is it of the Republic?, I mean if you see it from a certain point of view, the moment the security acts and the Clone Army were signed and authorized by the senate, approving the loss of liberty and human rights in the galaxy, the moment Palpatine seized control of the Senate and his ""temporary"" extra powers, it was the moment he trapped the Jedi into an absolute lose scenario, it prevented both physically and politically for the Jedi to overthrow him, he convinced the galaxy of the need of such military control, and by the time of the Clone Wars, even before Revenge of the Sith, he had already won, he had the galaxy, the Jedi, the Republic, all at his mercy and control.

Last month, LucasFilm announced ten new TV series / movies. The announcement received a lot of praise from Star Wars fans. I’m thrilled we’re receiving all this new content, but I feel Star Wars may become “watered down” and “over saturated” with all this new content. 

Don’t get me wrong... I’m really excited for the Kenobi series and even the Acolyte series set in the Old Republic. The rest I could easily do without. A lot of this is due to the wild success of the Mandalorian, but Just because characters like Boba Fett, Lando Calrissian, and Ahsoka are beloved by fans doesn’t mean they all need their own TV show. Keep it simple, leave some things for the imagination. 

I remember growing up during the Prequels and thinking to myself “What did Luke do after ROTJ?” or “how did Lando Calrissian meet Han?” and part of the magic of Star Wars is your imagination. I love the EU books and even some of the newer canon ones too. 

Part of the magic of Star Wars for me is waiting years for the next movie to be released and scouring over books, magazines, TV spots, etc for any new information I could.
Star Wars, the force, the Jedi, etc.  have always had this magical, mysterious feel , so in my opinion if they’re going to continue to release new content, at least just do it with all new characters than risking tarnishing the legacy of legendary characters.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1746147,public,self,,,Unpopular opinion: We’re getting too much Star Wars.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kzhwv1/unpopular_opinion_were_getting_too_much_star_wars/,,all_ads,6,,,,625e69e8-77ee-11e9-af39-0eef782999c6,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The series is a way to teach the following lessons in a very humane way.

1) Fathers need to look out for their kids and treat them in a well-respectable manner.

2) Fathers need to guide their children in doing the right thing.

3) Love is about sacrifice.

And most importantly.

Seeing the pre-OT, newer stuff, in comparison with OT made something really stand out. The Jedi in the OT are very underpowered compared to the prequels. Even someone as powerful as Darth Vader is a cunning duelist and uses very limited force telekinesis powers, throwing some random junk at Luke in Empire. Obi-Wan never uses any Force throwing abilities and Yoda pulling the X-Wing out of the swamp is this slow, energy consuming feat. Compared to that everyone in the Prequels is ripping walls out, throwing people across, making droids levitate and what not. It is incredible seeing Maul rip through a batch of Clones in the CW finale with nothing but his Force powers but there's a certain grace and deliberation in the OT that I really miss. I think even Rebels showed that in the way the untrained Ezra and Kanan fought, more as fencers and duelists than anime protagonists. I understand that a big part of this was the technical limitations in the 1980s but I still do miss the more subtle uses of the Force in OT. Does anyone else feel the same way and does anyone else wanna see that in newer SW content?

After that George Lucas didn’t plan on making anymore movies but when Disney stepped in they made the Sequels. This was an obvious direction Disney would take it as it would make them a lot of money and everyone wanted to see the OT characters because of how popular they were.

Now with the Sequels done they’re just in exactly the same place as they were at the end of ROTJ. Plus no offence but the Sequel characters are not as popular as the OT characters.

I love Mace and I love that he’d played by Samuel L Jackson. People are excited and want to see Mace again. People want him to be alive or think he survived but there is no good reason to bring him back. I have a lot more reasons as to why they should not bring him back. 

1. Obvious reason would be that he would undermine Anakin’s fall if he survived. 

2. They would take out Sidious’s only direct kill ona major character.  

2. They would need to dumb down both Vader and Sidious which I believe is incredibly stupid. It would make no sense for Vader and Sidious to not look for his body and confirm his death. He’s the only other person besides Yoda and Obi Wan that they hate and want to kill the most. Sidious didn’t stop looking for Yoda after he fell in their battle. Vader didn’t think Luke was dead when he fell in bespin. It would make sense and just stupid for them to suddenly be idiots for the sake of keeping Mace alive. 

3. He would invalidate the OT if he’s alive or still around that time and it would be even dumber if he survived it. The story of the OT is much better if there is no one that could beat the empire or had the best shot at taking them down if Luke is the only Jedi Knight around or the only Jedi that could do it. At least Ahsoka and Ezra weren’t official Jedi Knights while they have no chance against Sidious and Vader. Cal Kestis could still die before the OT happens and he has no shot at taking out Vader and Sidious. Mace is a straight up officially Jedi master from the old order and was the same guy who beat Palaptine in a duel and almost killed him. He was one of the most powerful Jedi of all time. This guy should not be around during the OT if he could do those things.

4. This is kind of adds on to reason 3 but at least out of the ones they did bring back, except for Sidious, the characters being Boba and Maul, They didn’t mess up the overall story of Star Wars or specifically the saga. Boba doesn’t mess up neither the OT or the ST. Maul didn’t mess up the PT or OT. Those two also didn’t have an arc in the movies which gave them a good reason to be brought back and be given those arcs. Mace actually did have an arc in the PT. They also had believable ways to survive. Maul used the dark side to survive. Boba’s “death” wasn’t all the believable in the first place. The man was wearing Mandalorian armor and went into the sarlacc with a bunch of weapons. If anyone was going to survive that, it would have to take someone like Boba or someone similar to him with the exception of force users I guess. 


5. The whole idea of him surviving is ridiculous anyway. For a Jedi to survive a fall, they would need to be conscious and focused to use their force powers to survive a fall like that but Mace was electrocuted by Sidious to the point where he looked just about brain dead or actually dead before he went out the window. Even if he did survive the fall, he would be badly messed up and Vader and Sidous would’ve confirmed his death. If weren’t looking for him, that would mean that they know for sure he’s dead. 

6. If mace were to come back, they would have to either kill him off or ruin his character. If he comes back before the OT, he needs to die for the OT to make sense. If he somehow survived, they would need to pull off another Luke from TLJ as to why he didn’t do anything for him to survive it all which I think would be BS when again, he’s the guy who beat Sidious in a duel and could’ve killed him.  The one other way that would make sense that people would like either would be if mace was absolutely crippled to the point where he can’t do anything. 

The only legitimate reasons to bring Mace Windu back and alive is because money and the fact that he’s played by Samuel L Jackson which will be exactly why he’ll most likely come back. It’s so odd how people had a problem with Sidious coming back for the sequels, me included and they needed up messed up the story of the first 6 movies in my opinion, yet they don’t have a problem with Mace coming back despite his death when it’s just as ridiculous and dumb to do so. If he’s going to come back since he will most likely come back now, he should come back but not be around anymore during the OT.

I noticed on my rewatch of ""Attack of the Clones"" it's Palpatine that suggests Anakin be the one to protect Padmé and bring her back to Naboo and be her bodyguard. Later, we all know &gt;!Palpatine!&lt; that brings Anakin to the dark side &gt;!by saying that he can save Padmé's life!&lt;.

The chemistry between Anakin and Padmé was always there, but did Palpatine take advantage of that to move his plan along by getting them together, or am I reading too much into it?

""Everything's fine here. We're all fine here, now. How are you?""

""I used to live here, you know."" ""You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.""

""Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? ""

""How we doing?"" ""Same as always."" ""That bad, huh?""

These kinds of lines are the basis for what would become a lot of mainstream, blockbuster style quippy writing and they are not that big of a departure from:

""So who talks first? You talk first? I talk first? It's just very hard to understand you with all the...apparatus.""

""Oh, read them have you? Page turners, they were not.""

""Amazing. Every word of what you just said was wrong.""

So, these complaints about the dialogue in the ST are just weird to me. It's the same quippy style that Star Wars has always employed and that, arguably, Star Wars popularized in the first place.

For Anakin's turn to the Dark Side and choice to follow the Sith, there's the obvious bait that Palpatine puts out about saving Padme. But I realized what I think is happening in Anakin's mind at that crucial moment when Anakin turns on Mace--and the Jedi.

It's basically ""Why must I always follow the rules and listen to authority, which I've struggled hard to do my whole life, but you Master Windu get to throw away the Jedi Code and kill Palpatine because *in your personal opinion* he's too dangerous to risk keeping alive to stand trial?""

He did that because he has a strong sense of loyalty and duty to the Republic. The Jedi were his heroes because he thought their job was to protect *the rule of law*. He'd clung to his idealized vision of the Jedi as Guardians of the Republic to keep him motivated to try to stick to the Light Side.

But in that moment where Mace Windu puts his own feelings about Palpatine above the rules, the ones that Jedi are supposed to protect and which say Palpatine has a right to a trial, Anakin sees a Jedi betray his duty. And not just any Jedi, a Jedi Master who sits on the Council itself.

The Jedi are not who they say they are. Palpatine was right. They're hypocrites, and only follow the rules when it suits them. And Anakin *hates* hypocrisy or wish-washiness about law and order. That leads to chaos, violence, and injustice. 

So that's the last straw for Anakin. He switches allegiance to Palpatine, to the Sith, an order that won't be hypocritical. An order where *everyone will be made to follow the rules.* The way of the Sith and the rule of the Empire became appealing to Anakin because they're not ""contextual"". They're clear about what they stand for and what's expected, with no exceptions. 

So I see now why Anakin ultimately decides the Sith and the Empire are, in his mind, the ""right"" side. They will bring order. No more messy democracy with its ""contextual"" ethics and people making exceptions for themselves whenever they feel like it.

In other words, I see now why Vader served the Emperor so loyally for so long. He really thought he'd chosen the right side, and would not tolerate any threat to that order. I can see why the Jedi were, in his mind, the bringers of evil into the galaxy. They brought all this hypocrisy, tricking the Republic into giving the Jedi more power than they deserved. Even the younglings weren't worth saving. They'd been too brainwashed already, and remained a threat if they'd been left alive.

It's interesting to see how his eventual confrontations with Luke end up changing his mind about his allegiance to the Emperor, but that's a whole other post. :)

I realize this is a bit of a strange question, but it popped in my head twice while I was rewatching the prequels over the past week. 

There is no doubt that Kenobi is probably one of the most loyal and selfless characters in Star Wars.  However, it’s pretty clear he’s also a bit of a stickler to the rules. I don’t think he ever really violates the rules/decisions of the Jedi Code/Council in the films. 

In AotC, when Obi-Wan and Anakin are on the way to confront Dooku, their ship gets attacked and Padme falls out. Anakin tries to go help, but Kenobi convinced Anakin to stick to the plan by asking Anakin what Padme would have wanted them to do. 

In the opening of RoTS as they’re going to board Grevious’ ship, a Clone squadron is attacked so Anakin attempts to go help. Kenobi convinces him not to by saying something along the lines of “they’ve got a job and we’ve got ours.”  

Obviously, these scenes aren’t proof that Kenobi would just sacrifice anyone to complete his goal.

Yet, I can’t help but wonder: Would Obi-Wan risk Anakin being captured, or even killed, to complete an incredibly important mission given by the council?

This question is framed under the assumption that these characters are still on good terms, so pre-RotS

The answer to the question ""When does Star Wars play?""  E. T. was released in theaters in 1982.  It is known to many Star Wars fans that E. T. meets a Yoda disguise on Halloween and thinks he is the real one.  Star Wars Episode I also features E. T.'s species in the Galactic Senate.  For me, Yoda is too young to have ever met E. T.  So I suspect the Yoda E. T. recognized was Grogu.  Since Yoda's species is around 900 years old, this theory suggests that Star Wars is set around 1000 AD.  Another possibility would be that E. T. realized Yoda himself.  Then we would be around the year 0 and the popular meme of the space Jesus named Obi-Wan Kenobi could come true.  These two considerations must be considered individually.

Now, I know I’m going to get a lot of, “I’m no Jedi” lines, per usual. However, this is exactly what Filoni brings up. There are no absoluteness forever and all time does things dominate your destiny. 

Ahsoka is a Jedi. As per Filoni she’s a Jedi master in the Mandalorian. She does not turn away from the Jedi order because she doesn’t want to be a Jedi. She turns away because they aren’t the kind of people who are doing and being what Jedi are supposed to actually be:

-Helping people.
-Keeping the peace.
-Seeking knowledge.
-Using the force for knowledge and defense. 
-Following the Will of the Force.
-Compassionate.

Ahsoka does not train Grogu because of the morals and philosophy of the Jedi and what it did to Anakin...so I thought and others, but LIKE Qui Gon (who is also a true Jedi), she sees the bond with Din and decides not to take the child away from his father. She embraces their bond. Not because she’s not a Jedi. She would 100% have trained him.

Vs Luke, who hasn’t experienced anything close to what Ahsoka has experienced in her life. Luke understands their bond, and feels it I’m sure, but there is no acknowledgement of his fear. After defeating and turning Vader he probably feels he could change anyone..until he experiences it with Ben Solo.

Am I? By the way I’m going strictly by the movies here as that is what everybody here knows at the very least

1. Her taking the Skywalker name is kinda dumb. I get she was pseudo adopted by Luke but caring for her doesn’t make her a Skywalker. They cared about Kylo Ren but he wasn’t a Skywalker, neither were his other protégées. And also her parents were taken when she was like 6 and I knew my last name when I was 6 so why didn’t she? And if her parents didn’t tell her her last name and she was going simply by Rey this whole time, then why change it at the end? It makes no sense to me. Like I do t wake up one day and say “I fEeL lIkE mLk ToDaY”! It’s dumb

2. She is wayyyy too op and gives bad implications for Luke’s and Anakin’s stories. Why is it that a Jedi can suddenly use force lighting in the movies now? That was a Sith specific thing since Grey Jedis aren’t canon and Jedis don’t use electric judgement in the movies then this is completely out of the blue. And since it’s discovered that Anakin didn’t kill Palpatine then he is no longer the chosen one. He never brought balance since Palpatine lived. That means that the movies are kinda implying that Rey was the chosen one which makes the prequels and original trilogy completely pointless since the First Order came around and made the destruction of the empire pointless. Now because of that, Luke’s entire purpose in the 9 movies is to train Rey, make a hologram, then die. All of his accomplishments were for naught so his entire character suffered as a whole. Not to mention how Rey is soooo much like Luke that they had to change Luke just for her to stand out. The way they handled Rey hurts Anakin and Luke so much.

3. What is her purpose in the movies? What is her arc? Her entire point at then end is to show that you aren’t who your family is but she didn’t learn that until the very end so it’s not like she is really that affected. She just is down in the dumps for like 10 minutes. I can’t figure out what her central character arc is in these movies or is she just there because they wanted a Jedi at last second? I don’t get it.

* This is my favorite Star Wars movie (if not one of my favorite films).
* Don't want to ruffle any feathers. 
* I'm only talking about the movies, any explanation in the comics doesn't count for this review on A New Hope.

So, with that out of the way, I'll just get into the things that bugged me with Star Wars. **TL;DR: (since this is a LOOONG post) EMOTION. NEEDS MORE EMOTION.**

**Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru** 

The two characters were the old family couple that prevented Luke from following his dreams in the stars. They served as the kind of obstacle for Luke to overcome to fulfill his dreams (like joining the Imperial Academy). I really have nothing bad to say about them, but the problem occurs with their deaths. 

After they got torched (whoever did that is anyone's guess), when Luke found his burning homestead, we have that famous scene where Skywalker is almost shocked to see what has happened to the closest parents he had. So, he does look pretty distraught. I would've expected this to lead to something, but after the burning homestead scene, this never gets talked about again. 

Luke travels back to Old Ben (who must've been standing in the same spot for an hour, but I don't know the distances involved) and they both agree to leave the planet. Luke never talks about Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru after that scene, not in the rest of the movie, not in the whole rest of the trilogy. Their deaths were forgotten. This doesn't make sense to me. 

I get it, Luke never had the best relationship with them, but they cared for him since (almost) birth, so I would expect Luke would've mentioned them a little bit more than what we got. Lucas must have forgotten about them. 

Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru just poof out of Luke's mind two seconds after the events, for all we know. Even though they might expand on this in the comics, I'm not talking about those, this is just my experience with the movie. 

**Old Ben and Biggs**   

Yet another case of Lucas forgetting about the deaths of somewhat major characters (maybe not too major for the latter), but Old Ben was implied to have some history with Luke. They probably interacted with each other a good number of times, so a friendship would've formed. Luke looked up to Ben probably more than Owen, so when Kenobi was struck down by a vengeful Darth, you'd expect this to make a lasting impression on Luke.

Now, you could tell it did. He screams, ""NO!"" while angrily shooting his blaster, and you even get a quiet scene of Luke mourning Ben's death, but when danger comes, that all is erased by shooty-shooty bang-bang. One successful repelled attack later, everyone is happy and Luke seems to have totally forgotten about the whole thing (the whole 'hearing Ben in his head' was implied to be that Skywalker thought he was just hearing things, obviously. I wouldn't count this as him accepting his death.). 

Now, I know having Luke be all sad would just slow down the pace of the plot, and I understand the need to keep the plot moving, as ANH is generally slow throughout already, but I just don't see enough **emotion** in these characters. This gets even worse with the Princess. 

For our ole' pal Biggs (I don't know if you count the deleted scenes as canon), he is tragically killed in action on the attack on the Death Star. With Biggs, this was Luke's best friend. They shared many moments with each other, probably went on adventures, and basically shared space-beer in a deleted scene. 

After Biggs (rest his soul) died, Luke, I think, just looked a tiny bit sad for a second, and then back to the battle. I can forgive that, as he was trying to survive himself and not be another floating scrap-pile, but when he destroyed the Death Star and journeyed back to the Rebel base, he is as high as a kite. Biggs death? Nah. I'm just going to mess around with Leia as a reward. (Well, that's just what I picked up on), so let me get this straight. 

Luke lost his parent figures, an old mentor, and his best friend, but he is hardly upset at all? Sure, you can say that since he was going through so much action, he just wasn't thinking about those things, but I disagree. The distances involved in Star Wars are massive, but if anyone disagrees comment.

In the ending, Luke is just fine. He winks smiles at Leia, she smiles back, he gets a medal, the crowd cheers, and that's a wrap. All of the deaths were forgotten and mostly not talked about again.

**Leia and Alderaan**

Switching to another character is Princess Leia. She's supposed to be the badass/tough female character that has snarky replies. I get it. What I don't get is Alderaan. So, Leia's home planet is Alderaan. That is where her Father is, parents, friends (probably) and that is where she lived her whole life on most of the time.

So, when the big bad of the film (Tarkin), decides to blow up the planet as a means of trickery, Leia shouts, ""WHAT?!"" The planet gets blown up. Everyone Leia ever knew is gone. Billions lost furthermore. Though after that scene, like Luke, that is just forgotten. She spends her time in a detention area to think things over (so you can't say she didn't have time to think about it), but when Luke finds her, she is in her snarky attitude (even though some say this is her coping mechanism, you'd still be sad. There should've been a scene of that, sorry.) 

I don't care how tough of a person you are. If your parents, friends, etc. were all destroyed and you had time for that to sink in, you would cry **or show some emotion.** Instead, though, this never gets talked about again. Leia moves on in about two seconds, and everything she knew being destroyed just doesn't matter. Instead, she'll just have fun with Luke and Han. See what I mean?

**Concluding Thoughts**

While this film is a masterwork, combing the old school with the newer age of filmmaking and plot, the emotions of the characters suffered a bit. Yes, Star Wars had an amazing rustic, lived-in universe that really made it unique (perhaps helped by the low-budget of the movie), but if you look at it the characters themselves, most of the emotions aren't there for me. 

When there are no deaths or other major things, the characters work just fine, but it is when the deaths happen that Lucas and his team overlook the most. You get two mourning scenes from Luke (each of which is pretty short) almost no scene of Leia being sad at all, and the film continues like nothing happened. 

Sure off-camera things could've happened, but that is implying that it wasn't important to the story. It is, though. While Ben would return in later films, Uncle Owen, Aunt Beru, and Biggs aren't talked about again. Even though years have elapsed, things still should've been hard for Luke. Leia... nothing ever seems to put a dent in her emotions at all.

This is one where Rey fails and Kyle truly goes to the dark side. 

The moment starts right after Fin gets slashed with a lightsaber. But this time the upward slash severely injured the top of his leg effectively resulting in fin needing a cybernetic implant to walk from then on. 

Rey, enraged by seeing Fin on the ground screams and utilizes a bit of the dark side to summon the lightsaber to her. (Her being a palpatine this makes sense) 

Kylo, stunned that Rey was able to use the force and that she tapped into the Dark side, realizes it is his chance to use Rey’s emotion against her. 

He starts taunting her, and he gives in to the dark side and not only accepts his father’s death, but the corruption makes him relish it. 

He gloats that Rey and the rest of the resistance will fall. He also says that if he could kill solo in front of Rey to make her suffer he would do it again. And starts to battle. 

Rey, now enraged, taps in to the Dark side once again. She starts mercessly slashing at Kylo but doesn’t land any hits. Kylo begins to tap into the dark side to overcome his injury from Chewbacca. His eyes begin to flash red as he lets himself be consumed. 

Snoke (actually palpatine) reaches from across the galaxy and begins to choke Kylo. Although Rey thinks it is her doing so. We see snoke smirk as Kylo struggles for breath. Rey, in her anger lungnes forward and just as Kylo breaks the chokehold Rey slashes, cutting Kylo’s lightsaber arm off from the shoulder. 

Instead of this mortally wounding Kylo, he taps deeper, every feeling of anger towards his mother, his father, and Luke powering him. Snoke, not wanting to lose Kylo just yet, aids Kylo in unleashing a torrent of force lightning as he simultaneously freezes Rey in place. He crushes Rey’s legs with the force. Rey passes out and crumbles in the snow. Charred and beaten down, Rey is picked up by Kylo as Kylo ignores his severed arm in the snow and drags Rey to the awaiting shuttle that has arrived. 

Chewie picks up Fin’s nearly lifeless body as Chewie begins to pilot the Millennium falcon, for the first time, alone. 

As Chewie flies away, we see starkiller base explode, although the planet itself is not destroyed. 

The shot we see is Kylo walking out of a similar contraption Vader’s suit was built in, eyes completely red. Cybernetic arm attached.

It just shot to the top of my list a few days ago because I noticed what they did with the lead.

The lead was female! They didn't stomp it down your throat the entire movie or in any of the trailers. It wasn't a 'people don't believe in me because I'm a woman' or 'ew, look at all the men sexing me up' type of action film like many modern female lead movies are. She was just there to kick ass for the greater good. Even relationships didn't feel weird because of different genders, it was just normal camaraderie with a love interest in the group. It held attention on the action, not the BS like that scene from Endgame (you know the one).

Now in this post I want to propose another game in the style of Tomb Raider and Uncharted. You play as Rey on a quest to find a holocron and maybe some ancient jedi text. 

1) Don't make it a typical ""save the galaxy"" type story.

2) The story should be a linear self contained story.

3) Made by Insomniac games...They did the Spiderman games

4) Cameo by Luke Skywalker as a ghost. He's a mentor and continuously helps rey in the game. Maybe you can even commune with past Jedi and Sith. Darth Bane cameo?

5) Shows the beginning of the new jedi order

6) Sets up a new villain. Possibly the Chiss ascendency or enemies of the Chiss?

7) A new customizable ship...retire the millennium falcon

8) Finn is a Jedi? Reys apprentice?

9) New never before seen in movies planets like Ryloth, Dromund Kaas, Korriban

10) First Order remnant 

11) Customizable Jedi robes/armor

12) Maybe instead of playing as Rey you play as Reys first apprentice and your character is customizable?

Am I the only one who thinks that's a horrible idea.

Especially when the alternative is just to make an animated series like clone Wars or Rebels that shows Luke taking down the remnants of the Empire and rebuilding the Jedi order. Personally I'd like it not to lead to the sequels but that's my opinion and not really something I want to argue about.

I don't understand this need for a live action Luke when nobody is ever going to be what Mark Hamil was. You have to worry about characters that can't be done with real actors anymore when you can just do an animated series. It worked with Anakin, Obi Wan and pretty much all the prequel characters, why not Luke, Leia and Han.

The prequels were not good movies with exception of the last third of RoTS. The Phantom Menace had Jar Jar, way too much politics, a critical under-utilisation of Maul, very poor writing, questionable scenes, overuse of CGI etc. 

Attack of The Clones had the absolutely horrible Anakin and Padmé romance scenes, Palpatine for some reason wanting to kill Padmé despite being vital to his plan to turn Anakin to the dark side, even more overuse of CGI, the same bad writing.

Revenge of the Sith for some reason started with Palpatine being captured with absolutely no explanation or background as to why, at least at its time of release. It still had horrendous writing, Anakin and Padmé's very awkward and hard to watch romance scenes still. Obviously it's the best of the 3 but not perfect by any stretch of the imagination.


So why are these films so praised now and yet the sequels are shunned when those same flaws present themselves?


The Force Awakens was not original. It copied a lot from A New Hope. But no, Rey is not a Mary Sue. She was shown to know a lot about ships as she literally survived by pulling them apart and knowing how they worked. She beat Kylo because he just got shot with a literal bowcaster and she was shown to be adept at physical combat with stick shaped weapons as previously shown. However, a lot of the humour in this movie was out of place and very very marvel like. Anyone going into TFA and expecting a completely original story from Disney was very, very misguided.

The Last Jedi is not as nearly as bad as everyone paints it to be. The dynamic between Snoke, Kylo and Rey is very well done. Luke was not ruined as people claim, what did you expect? If you went in expecting Luke to grab the lightsaber and go ""wow my father's and my old lightsaber, okay nevermind mysterious random Girl I will come with you and help save the day yay :)!"" Then I don't even know what to say. Luke is clearly dealing with his failure with Kylo and has disconnected himself with the force. However, the marvel-esc humour still continues and the whole side story of finn and rose was not very well executed.

The Rise of Skywalker is the worst of the 3. Lazy cop out ending for the saga and trilogy by bringing back Palpatine; just like what happened in the EU. The movie felt a lot more soulless then what came before and felt like JJ was just trying to fix up what he deemed the last Jedi had ruined. The dynamic between Kylo and Rey in this movie was amazing and the memory of Han that pushed Kylo over the edge into turning him back into Ben was the best scene of the movie bar none.

I know it doesn't matter ultimately and that it isn't like they are doing anything ""wrong"" or anything. I just feel like expressing my opinions. If you do not care for that, I am not forcing you to read or comment.)**

&amp;#x200B;

One of my biggest pet peeves with Star Wars is the gender double standards. But not necessarily for the reasons you might think or assume. Because yes, I do think that Star Wars is good at doing proper female inclusion (for the most). That's not what I am here to talk about.

&amp;#x200B;

But rather, I notice a lot of double standards that come across as weirdly arbitrary. One example I have with this are the Mandalorian helmets. Why does female Mandalorian helmets have to look different from male Mandalorian helmets? Why can't a male Mandalorian get to wear the female variant and vice versa? The female one is clearly based on ancient Greek helmets, which isn't even something I'd say is ""feminine"". Though, even if it was feminine, so what? Why can't we let anyone wear whatever Mandalorian they want regardless of their gender?

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing I notice is how alien species tend to depict the female variants as sexy by our human standards, but not the male variants. This is particularly true for both Twi'lek and Togruta. Females get these cute pretty faces and hourglass figures, but none of the male ones are depicted as even remotely sexy, and just have more weird unflattering head bumps or horns or shapes. Comparing Bib Fortuna with Aayla Secura is night and day, isn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of Aayla Secura, onto my next point. There are several female characters with sexualizing skin-revealing outfits a lot of the time in Star Wars. Aayla Secura and Ahsoka Tano are two famous examples in the Jedi Order alone, and Sith-wise we got Asajj Ventress. Yet, none of the male Jedis or Siths have that ever. Sure, I guess we've seen Kylo Ren topless, but not only was that very unflattering, but that wasn't him wearing a sexualizing skin-revealing outfit so much as he just removed his upper body clothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make it clear that I have absolutely NOTHING against female characters being sexualized. I am not one of those types who are complaining about Leia's slave outfit in Return of the Jedi - I rather see it as empowering that despite being forced to wear it, she eventually ends up strangling Jabba while wearing it, with the chains he used to keep her captured ontop of it.

&amp;#x200B;

And I am even fine with that the norm is the way it is. It's just that after SO many movies and TV shows being made in the Star Wars canon, I find it weird there are no exceptions to the rules, and why SO much in Star Wars canon fits with our conventional gender roles and double standards.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm one of those people who was introduced to it through Mandalorian. Then I played Jedi Fallen Order (great game) and out of curiosity, I began to watch the Clone Wars.

Before that, the only movies I had seen were the Sequels. Never seen any of the prequels or the orignals. Everything I knew was from my older brother and it wasn't much. Of course I knew basic characters like Chewbacca, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, and Darth Vader. Darth Maul was in there too. 

I stopped watching Clone Wars after season 1 because uuuh, COVID happened and I got *depressed*. Sometime back in July, I finally sat down and watched every other movie besides *Revenge of the Sith* and honestly I don't know why.

I love me some prequels memes but because the entire plot was ruined for me through memes, my experience was NOT good. I also had just finished binge watching the rest of Clone Wars because I needed other content besides Mandalorian. 

Nothing hit like it was suppose to. Nothing was impactful. I was afraid to watch it because I didn't want to cry but I just... stared. Soon as it was over and I went and rewatched the Bad Batch arc because I love Wrecker and needed to cleanse my pallette. 

Memes ruined a possible good experience and I'm pissed. I was hyping myself up to watch it by learning about everything that happens before it but it just... felt so out of place? I think I'm just gonna stick to Clone Wars and Mandalorian... Revenge of the Sith was just *disappointing* for all the (prequel meme influence) praise it had.

Before you kill me, let me explain.   

In Episode VII, Rey was afraid to move on from Jakku, insistent that she was meant to be there, even when she knew that her parents weren't coming back. However, she finds new people to care about, and discovers more about herself the farther she goes. In Episode VIII, having found a new family and faced with the prospect of losing it (having Han die, knowing the Resistance is in danger), she clings on to the idea of her parents, but realizes (as depicted in the cave scene) that who they are aren't important - it's who she is and chooses to be - a Jedi.   

In Episode IX, however, we see her struggle from the beginning because even if she wants to be herself, she fears now what that is. She is unable to be with the Jedi of the past because she is afraid of using her full power, partially because in not knowing where she came from, there's so much about her identity she doesn't know. And her worst fears are confirmed over the course of the film - not only does she see her power come out in terrifying force (destroying the freighter, stabbing Kylo Ren), but she learns that she is the heir to the Sith, a Palpatine. She runs away to Ahch-To because she doesn't want to face who she might be - but Luke comforts her because he's watched her grow, and knows that even through all the tribulations she went through, it didn't matter what she thought she was or where she thought she was supposed to be - she always put herself on the line to save her friends, her family, and that ran deeper than any blood within her.

Here, though at her darkest moment, having (seemingly) lost Ben and witnessing everyone she's ever known be attacked by Palpatine, she reaches out, but her inner turmoil is gone. She no longer is concerned about who she is; she gives herself to the will of the Force, not asking for the strength of the Jedi for herself, but for the galaxy. And she is given it. She stands up, reinvigorated, the will of Jedi past surging through her. They don't give her some kind of power boost; this isn't Dragon Ball. But Star Wars has always been about having the Force guide your actions, about having the will, not the strength to win a fight.   

When she charges at Palpatine, he simply projects overwhelming force onto her, and you can see her struggling - her arm wobbles and she is barely able to take it. As we learn later, this is killing her, and only her will is keeping her going in the face of lethal amounts of fleet-killing electricity. (Sort of like an inverse-Padme situation?) It's not really the second lightsaber that allows her to win against him (though it provides a tactical advantage, in terms of physical reinforcement) - it's him goading that he is ""all of the Sith."" Rey's will is only strengthened by the understanding that what happens now will determine the fate of the Galaxy - and that this is the fight every Jedi before her has fought. This is the do or die moment, and she knows what she has to do.   

I watched the moment that follows closely, and when she incinerates Palpatine, it doesn't appear that it's just a reflection of his own lightning - arcs of the electricity flow from her crossguarded lightsaber. Those are the bolts that hurt him, and I doubt that he would intentionally pump more juice into his own attack (I like to believe Episode III was a trick to goad Anakin). What do we see Rey do earlier in the film that emphasizes her connection to Palpatine? Use powerful jolts of Force Lightning. In this moment, Rey's arc reaches it's climax - she knowingly puts enough force to kill her into this final attack, but also accepts who she is - a Palpatine - by channeling her own lightning back at him through her lightsabers. While he is attacking, she counterattacks while blocking with bolts of energy strong enough to vaporize him... at the cost of her own life. But in that sacrifice, she protects her friends, avenges the Jedi, and saves the galaxy.   

It's a moment that could have been made more clear and rendered better, but when I think of it this way, it feels like a cooler ending.",True,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1743007,public,spoiler,,,"Repost of a comment of mine on the final showdown of TROS, especially the ""try it with two"" trick.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/ky6ezm/repost_of_a_comment_of_mine_on_the_final_showdown/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2. Everything that happened in ot and pt doesnt matter anymore and lets just go to the starting point of new Hope: Do not fucking touch what isnt broken. Empire lost, there are countless other possibilities than Empire V2. 
3. Every movie had different vision - poor planning of main arc. Just let one director and writer do whole trilogy cause instead you get huge mess like this and direction is changed each movie. Id even prefer rian Johnson to do whole trilogy than to have it schizophrenic like that.
4. Unnecesary clinging to old characters like han luke and leia. Sure give them some minor roles as a nod to the fans but constructing whole plot around them was a mistake.

I don't think it has to, if we keep a couple of principles in mind. So, here are my principles for approaching Star Wars lore in a way that helps us when there are multiple creatives telling stories in a single universe.  Any suggestions, disagreements, etc. are welcome.

1. Approach the SW story as an ancient mythology, not a modern science fiction timeline.

That SW is a mythos or fairy tales clothed in sci-fi tropes is well-known. Lucas was inspired by world mythology as he wrote A New Hope, and he starts his stories with ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" which is simply a new way to say ""Once upon a time. . .""

When we look at ancient myths like the Homeric stories about Troy and the voyage of Odysseus, what we find is a core narrative that is then embellished and expanded by later storytellers. For example, the Greek tragedian Sophocles writes a play about Ajax, a hero of the Greek warriors, centuries after the Iliad was written.

What this means is that it helps to see that there is a core SW narrative, which are the works of George Lucas, centered on the fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker (Eps 1-6 and CW cartoon). Anything after this, whether ""Legends"" or ""Canon"" is the work of subsequent creatives. They are secondary to the core narrative of GL. This doesn't mean that they aren't important or worthy, but if they tell stories about SW heroes that we think don't fit our sense of what it means, we can rightly see them as less authoritative than the core ""Homeric"" core, which is Lucas' works.  If we think that Sophocles' version of Ajax isn't faithful to the core depictions within the Iliad, we can just see it as a riff on the character, one that we are not obliged to make part of our core sense of the character.

In the same way, it's ok that there are occasional contradictions within the gamut of SW stories, as there would be over centuries of poets and scribes telling, recreating, and embellishing an earlier core narrative. This happens with the tales of the Pandavas in the Indian epic Mahabharata, Rama and the Ramayana, and other works that are retold by many people over the ages.  If you like the EU stories post-ROTJ and the sequels, that's fine. They are two subsequent developments that tell stories about the core heroes of the ""Homeric"" core  of the SW saga. Did Luke get married? Maybe something like that happened? Did he fail to build the New Jedi order? Well, maybe he succeeded but had a great crisis in the end, which he overcame with the help of some new friends. This leads us to --

2. Headcanon is important

Besides the core Lucas narrative, in the realm of subsequent storytellers, we invested readers have as much a right to our own headcanon as anything else. This is one way that we can personally resolve contradictions or choose not to accept certain approaches by secondary authors. As long as we are being clear, about not projecting it on to the original authors as ""their"" intent, such creative reception is is part of how myths and legends are carried on.

In my headcanon, Snoke/Palpatine knew that they could not defeat Luke and Leia directly, in fact, Palps used Snoke as a proxy because he was terrified of Luke. So, the main reason they wanted to go after Ben, to corrupt him, was actually to ""break up the family"" and take Luke and Leia out of the game. This was the direct cause of Luke's spiritual crisis in TLJ.

But, for the sake of argument, say you hate TLJ, that's ok too. You can just see it as one subsequent author's take on the mythology, one you need not incorporate into headcanon of the relevant lore post-ROTJ. Back in the day, did this with the EU stories when they would go too far ""out there,"" and if it prevents your love of SW from getting jaded, just do it now too. I saw the whole ""Force Unleashed"" story as a fun power fantasy, but never, ever saw it as part of my core narrative. And so on. 

Finally,

3. Don't take any particular character in SW to be a completely authoritative narrator.

Instead of making this post longer, consider reading what I put [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MawInstallation/comments/kjzrdi/limitedperspective_narrators_in_star_wars_a_note/) to understand this point. The basic idea is that  just as Obi Wan tells Luke that ""You're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view,"" we shouldn't take any particular character (and especially the depressed Luke of the middle act of TLJ!) as the single, perfect, fundamental interpreter of the universe or its ""message"".",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1742560,public,self,,,How to enjoy Star Wars without sweating the small stuff,0,[],0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kxzzgh/how_to_enjoy_star_wars_without_sweating_the_small/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And I think that while Christensen did an ok performance as Anakin, I didn't really think he portrayed the amount of emotion necessary for such a role. Most of his lines in 3 and all of them in 2 were either cheesy or completely wooden. Now I've heard the whole ""he's supposed to be awkward"" argument before, but I think that his performance didn't really capture that well and the acting just came across as... bad.

But, what *is* the Separatist Council? Dooku is analogous to the Supreme Chancellor, and the Separatist Parliament is analogous to the Galactic Senate, but what exactly is the role/function of the Council, on a governmental level?

Also, why are their corporations still represented in the Republic Senate? The Trade Federation, the Techno Union, and the Banking Clan are all represented in the Senate, by Lott Dod, Gume Saam, and Nix Card, respectively. The others are likely represented as well, just not shown. The Trade Federation is especially puzzling since it's a known fact that their leader Nute Gunray tried to have Padmé assassinated. And I seem to remember a line somewhere in TCW about how Gunray isn't a member of the Trade Federation anymore? But if that's the case what purpose does he serve the Separatists if he isn't in control of the company?

It just doesn't make sense that these corporations are allowed to participate in the Republic government when they are very conspicuously aligned with the Separatists.

I think it's misplaced and that the show actually explains some things that people haven't realised.

The biggest critisms I've read is: why would bo katan take the saber from sabine but not din and why would she be okay with taking off helmets but not taking the saber.

1st one is answered by what moff Gideon says towards the end. That it's not the saber that has power but the story. I'm guessing between losing the saber and the finale, bo katan realised that she needs to be part of the legend to get people to rally with her and to reclaim mandalore. Whilst a lot of people would go she's got the saber she's the rightful owner, others would say well she didn't earn it I'm not following her. She's basically failed as ruler and sees part of that because she was given the saber she didn't earn it.

As for the traditions thing. I think that's explained by the fact that she doesn't follow the watch traditions but the darksaber story is a tradition throughout most of mandalore, if I remember correctly.


Now this is a smaller thing but that staf. I just don't get why mando knew to bring it with them. Like why on that mission did he decide to equip it instead of his rifle. I think we should of seen him use it more in other episodes. He wasn't planning on facing moff Gideon and didn't know mu h about moff Gideon having the darksaber like I don't think it was mentioned. Bo katan mentioned wanting him but I don't think she was like hey he has a darksaber you should take that staff just in case.

They are both really great series over all and well worth watching. They both do however also have a lot of rather boring or irrelevant filler episodes that you can easily skip without really losing anything important. So I made this list of episodes that I would recommend actually watching. They are mostly episodes that either move the plot forward in an important way, have important character development, or introduce characters or story points that will become important later to the bigger story. I have been quite generous and been inclined to include rather than leave out when in doubt – and of course, this is also based on my personal taste of what kinds of episodes I like to watch.

So I have only recently started delving deeper into Star Wars, finishing clone wars for the first time last month and just started rebels..... so if I’m wrong about anything being canon just let me know. 

So Grogu is being trained as a Jedi. This would lead us to believe that in a fairly short amount of time he will have his own super mini saber. Now I THINK it is canon that krayt dragons have pearls that contain kyber crystals. With illum likely in control of the first order/remnants of the empire at this point, I’m wondering what everyone’s thoughts are on Grogu going and finding the kyber crystal from the pearl inside the krayt dragon that was killed in season 2.  In a very short 2-3 second scene they show the pearl so we know it exists, and while Star Wars has been all about fan service lately, it wouldn’t surprise me if they end up making that short scene more important than just an Easter egg for hardcore fans and have them return to the Krayt dragon to get the pearl.

# THE SETTING AND CORE IDEAS

&amp;#x200B;

The game takes place between Episode 6 and 7, with the death of the Emporer and Jabba the Hutt there is a large power vacuum in the outer/mid rim regions. Pirates, wannabe warlords and ex-Imperials are trying to gain control and a foothold in that region with the New Republic offering whatever assistance they can to local governments they can.

&amp;#x200B;

You play as a custom character (Think along the lines of Mass Effect for custom faces and different sexes but have the option to go silent for a KOTOR feel) where you choose your background (Farmer, Trader, Ex-Imperial and many more) where you decide/forced to go into the pirate/warlord business (One background could have you go into it so you can keep the farm or pay off a massive debt). At the start you hate it but the trainer/tutorial lead basically convinces you that if you don't do it someone else would have so you slowly get into it. Over the course of the journey your actions will have consequences ranging from killing everyone on board and gaining a massive bounty on your head or leaving everyone alive and be known as merciful but more recognized and making it harder to find higher paying targets (Kind of a play on Lightside/Darkside from KOTOR but instead of simple good/evil there are benefits and downsides to each option that could change the end of the game)

&amp;#x200B;

Either as an optional quest or a class you can become force sensitive. Rather than using it for the standard stuff we see we change it up by focusing on blaster use over melee/lightsaber. For example you can pull an enemy out of cover and fire at them or freeze all the blaster fire coming at you and pushing it back as a giant wall/ball to heavily damage the target. You could eventually get all the usual force powers in (Choke, lighting, heal and such) from collecting holocrons from private vaults but since you're (Possibly) taught them properly they're not as effective.

&amp;#x200B;

The majority of the game will be somewhat like Shadow of War where there are multiple open world locations (your HQ, a few stations and general planets for exploring and scouting.) that have a few secrets and collectables to put on display at your base/station.  Your HQ is where you can wander around to talk to crew members, upgrading your gear and ships, sending your captured ships/fleets out to do offline missions for loot and credits.

&amp;#x200B;

The story overall could have multiple endings where due to your lawful/merciful nature you help the New Republic and cut back on the piracy, unlawful could lead you becoming a warlord and carving a very nice chunk of the galaxy for your group. Though the hardest part is making sure it doesn't end up like the ending of Mass Effect 3 where it's a simple ""Pick a colour"" option, I'm wanting something more like New Vegas where being merciful to someone can cause them to kill a lot of people and stealing a certain cargo ship could mean you saved potential slaves (Unless you take them yourself) and of course it would be nice to have a betrayal from one or two of the starting group members due to greed or ideals.

&amp;#x200B;

# GAMEPLAY

&amp;#x200B;

Set as a third person shooter (For showing off your character and armour) you primarily focus on shooting, capturing ships, possibly multiplayer, attacking bases and managing bases and resources. Which I know is a bit boring but in the world of Star Wars it can be a lot better.

For the shooter part the game will let you select which blaster/slug thrower you want to use before going on a mission and whatever additions you want, ranging from ion grenades, thermal detonators, acid sprays and such. It will be a cover base optional shooter but mainly for just boarding ships, the larger the ship the more cover but also more people to shoot. Health will regenerate the last bar but the rest of the meter has to use bacta, force powers or stims.

Cover mechanics can be used for a breather, safe reloading and such as you're not a tank (At least not until you get good armour) but it can be like Red Dead where you can stay standing and shoot all your want or hide behind cover and fire safely.

Capturing a ship will first have you go to a menus and select your crew. For small stuff planet side it's roughly a crew of 4-8 you can select and starships range from 8-100 (I'll get to the larger one in a moment). You'll select your transport too it (Planet side it's speeder bikes and repulsor lifts and in space boarding vessels) select your gear and tell your boarding members how hot or loud they'll have to get (Non-lethal, lethal, assault and so forth). It then opens up to a cinematic of your group gearing up, driving/flying off and heading towards it. It will transition to the game upon seeing your character standing up and drawing your primary weapon after. The larger the ship the more resources you need to capture it whether it's another speeder or supplying your group with starfighters to clear out the defences and punching a hole in the ship (Thinking a Star Destroyer would be the end-game ships you can capture). Upon capturing a ship you'll take it back to base, loot it and either repair it and keep it or sell it off for more credits.

Loot will be tricky but I was thinking of splitting it up between ""Loot"" which is stuff you sell for profit, ""Materials"" which are then broken down between upgrading materials, ""Spoils"" which you can give to your group to boost morale and pay them. 

For base management it kind of starts off with your chosen start so let's go with Farmer. You start with a ""hanger"" (Barn or something), base of operations (Your home), Storehouse (Materials for safe keeping) and ""mission board"" (Terminal that tells you what's nearby to loot/attack). Over the game you slowly upgrade your starting area so it's nice and productive (Long range scanners, defences and such) but eventually you'll get attacked and forced to run away. There you can choose on which planet you'll go next and possibly have a station or a Star Destroyer as your final base (Multiple SD can be sold off or used by NPC's) but in any base you'll upgrade it more for more resources (Gathers and such), more missions and to customize the place and fleet for you.

Multiplayer is a bit of a hard one on whether or not I want it in. On one side connections and hackers, on the other we could have something akin to Metal Gear V and Shadows of Mordor as in players can attack each other, loot their stuff and try to become the number one pirate/warlord in the game. Would mean there will be constant flux so you can use your resources and get a lot more action. MGV side of things I like the idea of jumping out of the open world gameplay side to jumping in to help defend your base from a player but it depends on how we handle the mechanics and the Mordor side is to basically raise an army.

For a mix of base management and multiplayer there could be special stations you can occupy MASSIVE credit/material gain or for faster research on upgrades (First time mentioning it) so there will be a need for that.

Research will be tricky as you're not gaining technology you built yourself (Could be a thing?) but gaining new trading lines/deals so you can upgrade your weapons from junky Clone Wars era stuff to Civil war era and finishing on modern, same goes for ships. Can start off base assaults and high speed/capacity raids with a breaking down LAAT but slowly getting a MUCH better drop ship.

If we figure out a way to incorporate starfigher combat we could but if you're controlling a cruiser or a SD then the mechanics will be a bit tricky. Maybe a fighter assault mode that lets you weaken their defences before you board your ship and fly over in the boarding craft or let you choose between flying or letting you AI members go aboard and capture it themselves.

Jedi and Dark side wielders CAN be in it to try and influence a force sensitive character but they could be replaced by figure heads of the New Republic, Crime Syndicates and Imperial Remnant trying to sway you to help them more than to help yourself.

For the AI/Group members they can start off as being your family, friends, subordinates or hired guns (Depending on background) and as you board, raid and level up you get people who join up with you randomly (Like they flew to your base and said they want to join or sending you a message asking to join) or you can recruit from freeing slaves and such. For the base attack/defence side you can select a non-story driven character to defend a position with a group of people or lead the charge. (Think Shadow of War for that respect). All the NPC's range from Humans, Aliens (All prequel, OT and Sequel trilogies for diversity) and droids. In fact you can have an entire droid army if you wish for assaulting bases and defences but unless you get a good commander type droid they're no good and ship raiding or complex positions (Or basically bulk defence/swarm tactics)

Lightsabers could be added but can't be used in a PvP match as some or most players may not go for one, even then if they find beskar or vibrobladed weapons they can then let lightsaber players in just then they can be evenly matched. Would have something similar to Jedi Academy or For Honor, both require skill but one is easier to handle and since sword/spear combat isn't common in the galaxy it makes sense the player won't be on the same levels as Jedi's and such.

Could have a relationship system where the core members could be a romance option, bonuses and such. Actions can change how they view you and they can bring it up and generally judge you on stuff they don't like. Maybe for the final chapter in the game if your loyalty with them isn't high enough they ditch, betray or simply die during the battle.

&amp;#x200B;

# BOARDING

One of the core gameplay mechanics. For interior sections have it be randomly generated on the path to the bridge, hanger and engine room. So for an example let's go with an *Arquitens***-class command cruiser.** Upon entering the ship it will randomly have certain hallways, rooms and doors open and close for different paths and ease of memory. Upon entering the ship you'll be hit with waves of enemies and there are three ways of winning: 

  
1) Killing everyone. This one sounds simple but can be a lot harder than it is. On smaller ships and crafts it's quite simple, shoot the driver and crew members and that's it. But say you're going after a Star Destroyer you'll have to kill 37,000 members in order to win that way. (Added note capital ships like a Star Destroyer will be rare. Like once a day you can get a mission to do it and not simply run across one)

2) Locking the ship down. A bit harder but will let you capture everyone on board so you can either try to recruit them, ransom them to their factions, enslave them or simply vent them. You'll have to hit up the bridge and engineering in order to do this, leaving a good number of people in each place to ensure it's secured (And you may have to run back to help support them while the other half is heading towards the other area)

3) Docking it to a larger ship: If you have a large enough ship in your fleet you can dock smaller ships on then it's simply a timer. If you're boarding a **GR-75 medium transport** and simply wait for it to dock with a larger ship than the crew will more often than not surrender.

&amp;#x200B;

# BASE RAIDING

This one can be done in two ways and both in my mind can be quite fun: Full Assault and Stealth Ops.

Full Assault is basically an invasion and like Mordor. You select what all ships, weapons and gear everyone uses for their groups and you choose where you start off at, you could charge in through the front with the bulk of your forces or take a dropship and land on top of a tower to start sniping people so your forces have a bit more ease. You win it by killing or capturing the Bases boss after which you can claim it for yourself, steal all that's in it or knock it down a few levels and leave it for the original player.

Stealth Ops goes the MGV route and you silently approach the base, go around and can sabotage stuff for a future assault or sneak your way in and try to capture it without the player who owns it knowing it till it's too late.

For defences you can build a droid factory so that it can produce ""unlimited"" droids to defend you but takes up resources, have artillery and flak weapons to help reduce support, shields protecting above and so forth. NPC bases can have certain levels and things they'll have but players are allowed to use everything to ensure safety.

I love the memes I love the characters the worlds everything. But one thing all the trilogies lacked was a plan. The prequels and the sequels showed this the most. 
This is what I would change:
(Feel free to add input and add what on)
IMO the original trilogy is fine I can’t think of a way to change it honestly l

(TLDR at bottom)

Sequels:

Okay so this trilogy is def the worst out of the three and was 100% poorly executed and had sooooo much potential. 
Instead of mentioning and saying that the new Jedi order failed and Kylo Ren turns to the dark side why not be the whole premise of the movies? Why not let Rey and Finn (he is shown to be force sensitive in the last movie so it would be cool to see him as a Jedi) be other learning Jedi? They vaguely say that the new Jedi order failed but if we SEE it happen like in revenge of the sith that would be crazy especially it it happens in the first movie. The whole idea of Luke giving up is not like him at all Mark Hamill said it himself. 

Another big thing the sequels did was show us the new characters perspectives which isn’t bad but that kept us away from the bigger picture. In the Phantom Menace balanced it perfectly. It has fan favorite Obi-wan an original character that we the audience is comfortable with. It also shows a new character Qui-gon Jin and a great villain Darth Maul who sadly didn’t get to do much. But see how it took former characters and new Characters and built a new story together. 

EXAMPLE: When the entire republic that supports the resistance under the table gets blown up by star killer base why should I care? We didn’t get to know the new republic. 

We should see the how the senate, chancellor and the new Jedi order interact like the prequels because that’s the whole point of what they we trying to accomplish in the OG trilogy, to get back to the point of the prequels. In a little over 30 years they barely accomplished anything. Most importantly we should see an old character like Leia taking an active role in the politics. As much I hate politics it builds so much of the world in the prequels and helps you as the audience understand Palpatine’s motives as he is actively influencing the senate (this is seen in Jar jar giving him emergency powers). 

As you can probably tell I feel they wasted the sequel trilogy and wanted to play it safe that’s why force awakens was a new hope copy. Disney had all this money and no plan. They could have made the first movie and drafts for the next 2 before even announcing the sequels. 

TLDR: Disney fucked up the sequels by playing it safe and not having a plan. My plan for the sequels would be to show the new republic with the semi established Jedi order with Luke like the new Yoda. And also show the fall of Kylo Ren with him being more of the main focus. 

I have better ideas for the prequels so if this does semi well I’ll do another post.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1741720,public,self,,,Here’s how I would change Star Wars (sequels),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kxq7pz/heres_how_i_would_change_star_wars_sequels/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Didn't the Empire love orbital bombardments? Or am I just dumb?

Because they totally could have used the clone wars as reason they started that.

In the Clone Wars, the CIS was fully automated, all droids, so they'd just orbital strike them to not risk their clone troopers. Because that'd be fuckin immoral otherwise. Why should I go risk my life for this, we can just orbital strike the positions of these ROBOTS, yes robots, we're alive and they aren't. Nuke them, it's fine, it's not like they feel it.  


If there's a local village nearby down there and they have to blow it up too, or maybe it fucks up the planetary climate, well, Palpatine could just say 'their population is a third of what our invasion force is, so if we just Base Delta Zero these guys we'd lose less beings total than we would if we invaded. Sometimes war sucks.' Could be a whole moral quandary thing going on, could help fuel the rebellion later on.

And then now that's precedent set and when you have Palpatine become the Emperor and people get uppity about it he can be like 'Look I have glassed entire planets before, I'll fuckin do it again' and people are like oh shit u right, and the Death Star just ends up being the ultimate symbol that strategy",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1741510,public,self,,,Random thought of the day regarding Base Delta Zeroes,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kxn682/random_thought_of_the_day_regarding_base_delta/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She describes her family as the beginning middle and end, it caught my attention and I wondered if they were representing Anakin specifically as beginning middle and end. Now obviously these characters are a biblical reference, as the father son and Holy Spirit in Christian belief the daughter being the spirit (her whisp like from my only evidence). But there is a sort of spin on this as those three entities are separated from Anakin the “jesus” character, born from the force (god) without a father. So maybe these characters are representations of his life specifically as the chosen one, the one born out of the force (Even weirder is while on this “force planet” Obi wan meets with Qui gon almost like they’re in heaven making the reference to the trinity seem more possible). To be more specific on how these characters represent Anakins life in 3 major parts (a trilogy one might say), I gotta talk about each individually. Take this idea with a grain of salt as it’s pretty unrefined and I just thought of it before starting this post.

The Daughter is the innocence and kindness of Anakins youth, the female influences that had a major part in his early development. Namely Padmé and his mother Shmi these characters effect his whole life directly and indirectly. He looks up to and loves both of these women dearly hence her nearly angelic appearance. This character dies at the hand of the Son.

The Father is like the maturity and wisdom of his adulthood and even tries to mentor Anakin. This is likely his view of Obi wan while also reflecting his peak of wisdom and power as a jedi. This character ends up dying at the hands of the Son as well.

The Son is Anakins end he is the darkness the jealousy the fear and anger of Anakin, first hinted at in his over protectiveness of the Daughter. This character even goes so far as to show Anakin his personal future of becoming Darth Vader (if I remember right). His increase in power reflects Anakins gradual fall, his killing of the Father and the Daughter reflect Anakins loss of family the ones closest to him Obi wan and Padmé. This solidified the Sons and Anakins fall into a life of hatred and solitude, I’d go so far as to say the Son is how Darth Vader would look if he won on Mustafar. 

Side note something interesting to think about is Anakin becomes the father of a daughter, as well as a son. Perhaps the father also represented the possibility of Anakins life as a wise powerful middle ground, in comeplete balance. Maybe each was a representation of the possibility of the chosen one, but when the Daughter and Father died he was truly doomed to fall.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1741443,public,self,,,"The Father, the Son and the Daughter",0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kxm0n4/the_father_the_son_and_the_daughter/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For reference, im talking about [this video](https://youtu.be/Ey68aMOV9gc)

Star Wars Theory is a rather large voice in the YouTube community and I guess I’m hoping his vision of what makes Star Wars great isn’t listened to by Disney in any way, or a lot of other fans for that matter.

I wasn’t going to call him out like this but after seeing his complete dismissal of Ryan Johnson’s work on The  Last Jedi, I thought it was fair game. 

Here’s what my issue is with his Vader fan film: it’s so over the top, much like the rest of his theory videos. And in my opinion, he’s completely missing the point of Star Wars and what makes it so good. 

Star Wars Theory thinks that Darth Vader deflecting like a thousand blasters at once while choking the fucking Emperor is awesome when it is really just silly. I know it was a dream sequence but that was supposed to be the ‘cool’ action piece of the fan film and god was it so ridiculous. 

But then, afterwards, Vader wakes up and is summoned by the Emperor. We then see a extremely dragged out dialogue between Vader and The Emperor and it’s just exhausting, especially since the actor playing old Sheev is....lacking to say the least. 

The only two parts that I actually liked was the shot of Vader waking up in his chambers and we see a very impressive visual of Vader without his suit and the shot of the Star Destroyer/Venator in space which was equally impressive. Props where props is due. 

I guess my takeaway is that Star Wars Theory is wrapped up in The Force Unleashed side of Star Wars, over powered force users with unlimited ability and over the top ‘what if’ scenarios. It’s the basis of his channel and it’s bad for the community if you ask me. It’s adding to the odd and unreasonable expectations that Star Wars fans obtain whenever something new that is canon comes out. 

Star Wars has cool action sequences, yes; However, what makes Star Wars so great in my mind is the complexity of its characters and struggles of its characters. It allows for moments that give so much emotion that it can make someone cry. 

Compared to what Star Wars Theory has always made content about: over the top theories, emotionless scenarios, and unrealistic expectations. Perhaps he’s just not for me, but I’d rather watch a 30 minute conversation between Han and Greedo before I watch Vader do all of that crazy shit. He’s also one of those fans that would rather 50 year old Luke Skywalker to be some insane Jedi God instead of giving him, like all of us, flaws and relatable struggles. I don’t, he’s just not for me and I’m not a big fan of his sequels hate.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1741424,public,self,,,I’m going to be a critic here: The Star Wars Theory Vader fan film was........not very good.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kxln8e/im_going_to_be_a_critic_here_the_star_wars_theory/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* With the fall of the New Republic, the impending collapse of the First Order, and the weak state of the Resistance, the galaxy seems to be left with a power vacuum. After the Battle of Endor, the Rebel Alliance had enough power and claim to legitimacy to assert control over any other anti-Imperial factions, but such does not appear to be the case with the Resistance and the spontaneous revolts against the First Order. Both the Sith and the Jedi (as an institution) are gone. Perhaps the most powerful systems may band together and form a confederation, but perhaps galactic civilization may simply collapse into countless warring states, a larger version of Japan's  [Sengoku Jidai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengoku_period). Whatever the case, power politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum...
* Even if they were destroyed, the Final Order's planet-destroying Star Destroyers have pretty terrifying implications for the future of galactic warfare. Force juju aside, what their existence means is that the capacity to miniaturize DeathStar style technology into a mass-produced space cruiser is near or already within the technological and manufacturing capabilities of relatively smaller military powers that lack the old Empire's infinite resources. Sure, you could argue that the technology was lost at the end of the movie, but how long would it take for someone else to independently recreate it. And we know that there are countless warlords who would use it...

I still have those old vhs tapes packed up somewhere.

Although it wasn't easy, I was able to find the theatrical versions to watch online. To this day I've never seen the special editions, and I never will.

As a kid I always preferred Return Of The Jedi over The Empire Strikes Back, but having re-watched them as an adult my opinion has now changed. The Empire Strikes Back is definitely the best of the original three films. It was just amazing.

Imo Return Of The Jedi seems to have some tone problems. One minute it's almost like a kids movie and then the next it's super dark and serious. Return Of The Jedi is still a very satisfying ending to the trilogy and wraps up the character arcs very nicely.

Also something I noticed while watching was these movies didn't feel long at all. Each movie is about two hours long but they don't feel that long. That's something I really liked about them.

Also the special effects were amazing.

I'm gonna be honest, the only movies I like are the original trilogy. There's some things I like about Revenge of the Sith, and Rouge One, but as a whole I don't like Prequel trilogy, or the sequel trilogy, nor do I like the spin off movies. By the way it's cool if you like them but I just don't.  

I haven't seen The Clone Wars or Rebels yet. I've heard a lot of great things about them so I'll check them out at some point.

It was the first time that I’d ever seen a Star Wars movie in theaters. I loved Star Wars prior to the release of the Sequel Trilogy (The OT was my favorite of the two pre-existing trilogies) and watched the movies over and over with my SW-loving dad. 

I was ecstatic when I learned that The Force Awakens was being made. The days crawled by until the opening day when I could *finally* watch that iconic Star Wars crawl and hear the triumphant Star Wars fanfare in theaters *for the first time*. 

*The Force Awakens* was everything I’d hope for. It was pure magic getting to see a Star Wars movie roar to life on the big screen surrounded by fellow fans. My old on-screen heroes were meeting new ones. *Han was swashbuckling around the galaxy again! Leia was a General! Chewie’s back!!*   
 I was inspired by Finn’s bravery, friendship, and fortitude, and loved Poe’s unshakeable confidence, caring, and daring. Kylo was intimidating and terrifying – he wasn’t Vader, despite his efforts, but he was his own kind of supervillain. Could my old-and-new heroes survive against someone so cruel, unstable, and powerful??

And *Rey*. Rey was my favorite of all. Even though she was brutally alone, she was independent, capable, kind, and brave. She refused to let the harshness and cruelty of her daily world make her its human mirror. She was a young woman in a world that had up until now seemed dominated by men and their deeds. Star Wars had been a love of mine for a long time, but I personally often felt like being a girl was a barrier to adventures in the galaxy. Padmé and Leia, as much as I admired them, never got to have the same types of adventures as my heroes Han and Luke. Seeing Rey save the day, fly ships, defy evil, and ultimately wield a mighty lightsaber on her path to becoming a Jedi was a tremendous gift to a fan like me. I wore my hair in “Rey buns” and collected her action figures and posters. I read the novel over and over, eager to guess where the story would go next.   
   
*The Last Jedi* barreled into theaters and continued the adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed this newest addition to the saga. I identified strongly with Rey desperately trying to find her place and her purpose in a world that often felt huge, confusing, and alarming. The movie succeeded in thawing my dislike for Kylo into pity. *Failure was OK, and was in fact a valuable tool!* Your mentors and elders will sometimes confuse you and let you down – that’s OK. They’re still learning, too. 

I disliked Admiral Holdo at first (how dare she talk to Poe like that! Was she a traitor to the Resistance?), but loved her when I realized the true depth of her commitment to her mission and ideals. She was willing to die to save what she loved. It was a valuable lesson to not judge a book by its cover.   
Saddened as I was by Rey and Finn’s separation, I loved Finn and Rose’s adventures as the two raced to save the Resistance. Despite the grave importance of their task, they still took time to release the Fathiers and inspired the children who lived in such terrible conditions. 

Snoke, Rey, and Kylo’s scenes were electrifying. I was horrified when I thought Rey might join Kylo (I couldn’t blame her – he was offering her so much of what she’d hoped for). I was thrilled when she stood firm and fought back, fighting against her own wish for belonging in order to save the Resistance. 

Luke’s final, heroic stand against the First Order and Kylo was incredible. Here was a man who had suffered through so much for so long, making the final, ultimate sacrifice to save his friends. 

*The Last Jedi* was a deeply thoughtful movie that still makes me think about its themes whenever I watch it. I couldn’t wait to see the conclusion. 

*The Rise of Skywalker* began. This was it; this was the culmination of the journey that my heroes – and myself, to an extent – had embarked on. I *loved* it. Rey, Finn, and Poe were back together again. Palpatine was back and more determined than ever to destroy the light – with wrathful Kylo by his side, I was afraid he’d finally succeed. My hero, Rey, was struggling increasingly under the pressure, expectations, and stress placed on her. My daily stressors and concerns were nowhere near rival to hers, but even silly real-world worries can sometimes feel galactic in proportion when you’re young. Lando’s reassuring words that no one ever feels “ready” and his gentle reminder to lean on your friends in hard times were healing balms. Seeing Rey stand strong against the greatest of evils with the voices of past Jedi encouraging her was magnificent. She'd gone from being unsure and uncertain of her place in the world to fully embracing her powers and destiny. She'd come a long way from the scavenger on Jakku. 

Watching Rey finally find her “family” (the Resistance/Skywalkers) and fulfill her destiny as a Jedi, seeing Finn claim his “family” and natural courage, and watching Poe embrace the mantle of steady leadership brought my heroes story arcs to their apogee. Despite facing herculean struggles, they prevailed. They *won.* 

As Rey and BB-8 watched the suns set on Tatooine after being welcomed into the Skywalker family, I was so happy.  I left the theater wanting to bounce around with joy. It was the perfect ending, but also felt like a new beginning. *What happens now?* I wondered, feeling the same way as I had when I watched the jubilant celebration at the end of RotJ. My heroes could go anywhere from here – what adventures would they pursue now; what conflicts would they resolve? I hope to find out one day, but for now, my own imagination will have to provide the answers. 

In the meantime, I’ve been loving *The Mandalorian*, voraciously reading through the canon novels, and I’ve just started to dip my toes into the animated series (thanks, *Mandalorian*, for getting me curious!!). 

The characters, stories, and adventures from all the trilogies, but *especially* the Sequel Trilogy, will live in my heart forever. To borrow a quote from the tyrannical Moff Gideon – and our friend Din – the Sequel Trilogy “*means more to me than you will ever know*.” 

Now: I fully understand that not every Star Wars movie is going to be everyone's cup of blue milk (Attack of the Clones is personally my least favorite) – it’s completely OK if you don’t like something. That's not a reason for us fans to be unkind to each other about what we individually love. I've personally found that every Star Wars movie has *something* wonderful to offer.

Here’s to the galaxy far, far away and the tremendous joy and wonder it brings to fans of all ages.

I have seen some walkthroughs and know stuff about them but havent personally enganged with them. That being said, from what I saw, the story and charactes werent really interesting.

The way the story handled the origin of the Rebellion, Galen being so powerful and able to beat Vader or stand up to the Emperor just didnt do it for me personally.

Since people wanted him to be brought back I was brainstorming ideas about it.

He could be another Inquisitor, powerful in the Force (not like the games though, normal powerful) and hunt down Jedi or do various oter assignments. He wouldnt be nearly strong enough to beat Vader or the Emperor though and he wouldnt have the extremely central role the games gave him. They could also keep him slowly turning to the light potentially. I dont know if he could be Vader's ""secret"" apprentice given the new Canon though.

You see, I am thinking about writing a Star Wars Rebels FanFiction and my plan was to make a stolen Imperial Arquitens their base of operations for my protagonists. The main problem with my plan here is that there would only be 9 people aboard the ship to man it. 

Would it be possible for this to even work? I mean, I could make the excuse that the ship was been modified to have automated systems to accommodate a smaller crew. However, since this is taking place during Rebels when the Rebellion was just beginning, that doesn’t seem likely given the size of the ship and the amount of resources needed to modify a ship like that.

The point is, can a crew of only 9 be able to man a ship like the Arquitens, if so, that’s great, if not, what ship would be possible to be manned by only 9 people?",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1740813,public,self,,,How many people can man an Imperial Arquitens-Command Cruiser at minimum?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kxcfwb/how_many_people_can_man_an_imperial/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The High Republic, Disney plus shows and new games. EA still has the license just so some people know, they didn't loose it but it just expanded to other companies. Anything is on the table with Star Wars games, I never thought I'd say that but yesterday  that changed. Lucasfilm said they have more to announce. I feel like Ubisoft and EA won't be the only company to make Star Wars games. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I want from an open world Star Wars game? I want to have amazing battles, a spot on story, gives homage to the lore, I want to eat and drink stuff in the game, tons of side quests and not just collectibles. I want to see diverse life and npc behaviors on the planet, I want to see tons of detail and immersion and an amazing soundtrack. Their are so many games that I want but here are the top 6 games I want.

1. Star Wars Battlefront 3. This can be the main multiplayer game for Star Wars fans.  This is possible now and I'm pretty excited. Battlefront 2 meant so much too me. Playing supremacy with the boys late in the night and just having so many fun moments.  Battlefront actors are getting back together to do more work. If this happens then it needs to be different then Battlefront 2 and way bigger. Include all the skins, hero's and villain's, weapons, planets and modes. Add characters from the Disney Plus shows and planets from the disney plus shows, High Republic, even the Old Republic and add the stuff from Battlefront 2 that we never got. This will probably be on next gen consoles so obviously good graphics and make supremacy bigger with more objectives and action. Include new and diverse modes and add way more tracks. I'm a nerd for soundtracks in games and Battlefront subreddit had an amazing concept for a soundtrack update. I'd be fine without having a campaign. This game has so much potential. EA should take the feedback to heart. This game probably won't come until like 2022 or even 2023.
2. Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order 2. Fallen Order was a pretty solid game and I think it helped kickstart the new era of Star Wars games. The story and combat was really fun and interesting. Cal was likeable and I want to see where he goes next. What if he joins the rebellion or tracks down Yaddle. Vader is hunting Cal as well so another showdown would be really cool. This will probably come out next year, that's my guess.
3. An Old Republic remake. I've never experienced this game nor the era. It's looked so cool and I'm pretty sure Old Republic is canon again. I'm not sure. So I really would like to see this and get the opportunity to play it.
4. A High Republic game. This new era has so much potential and I've read some of the books. It's pretty good and interesting. It would nice to travel around the galaxy and see some of our favorite planets in a different form. The era is like the Wild West where so much of the galaxy is still unexplored. Here's the thing, people are more likely going to want to experience the era in a game or movie or tv show. This new era shouldn't be limited to just books. We'd get to use new ships and even maybe learn about new force abilities. I'd include the starlight beacon outpost as a main area and  Coruscant as well. I'd also include new planets and familiar ones. During this era the sith are in hiding so maybe easter eggs that tease the sith's return
5. A bounty hunter game. Star Wars 1313 isn't going to happen. But due to the success of the Mandalorian a bounty hunter game is bound to happen. I think this will probably be Ubisoft's game. I do hope it isn't about the Mandalorian, I want something original. Here's what I hope Ubisoft does with the game. Put the setting during the reign of the Empire, your bounty hunter is customizable with weapons, you can have companions, tons of clothing options, ships along with customization options for it, you can take bounties from the bounty hunters guild, rebel cells or the Empire. Different scenarios can happen such as you being too late or you walk into a trap. You also can transport people and items, hunt a certain creature, collect an artifact, protect a convoy or raid convoys.  A bounty hunter is after money so their would be benefit's on who you take bounties from. If you take more bounties from the Empire then you can get away with certain crimes, you can bribe officials, you get higher targets, different customization options, if you side with the Empire more often then the Rebels won't trust you as much, and can even meet notorious people in the Empire. People can hire bounty hunters to go after you. If you work with the rebels then you get more intelligence, different customization options, new companions and different gigs. You can even get the option to join them. If you leave the Guild then more bounty hunters can go after you. If you do join the rebels then the Empire will send Death troopers after you and Tie fighter squadrons. The game would have a huge variety of blasters and melee weapons. I really hope Ubisoft does this with their game.
6. A game where you play as the villain. You can honestly put it in any era. It would be really cool to play on the other side. I'm not going to go over everything that they could do but I'm sure you get the idea.

Here are some honorable mentions  that I would like to see.

1.  A squad game similar to Republic Commandos. Maybe Death Troopers or the Bad Batch.
2. A character from the Disney Plus shows are bound to get a game. Maybe a Luke Skywalker game based after Mandalorian Season 2. Luke, R2 and Grogu travel around the galaxy learning more secrets about the force, the Jedi,  the Sith and learning more about Grogu. 
3. A game based in the Clone Wars.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1740807,public,self,,,Star Wars games I really want to see.,0,[],0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kxcdev/star_wars_games_i_really_want_to_see/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So high was his Midichlorian count, that he was taken in by the Jedi Order, to be trained to become the Chosen One and to bring balance to the Force.

But myself and others have realized that JJ Abrams had a TON of difficult things to deal with when making Rise of Skywalker which is why I wish people would be less hard on him for the things they didn't like about it. These things make his work sound like the most difficult movie ever made if you ask me. 

\-He had to deal with the death of an important character's actress and use only old footage of her (while Last Jedi filming was done before Carrie died). One redditor said this was like having to make Black Panther 2 with only unused footage of Chadwick Boseman. 

\-Disappointed and/or angry fans of the last movie (but not critics as they loved 8) and toxic Star Wars fans that strike almost everytime a new movie comes out. If I were him I would try to please fans but not give in to the toxic ones but at the same time don't want to risk things happening again such as Kelly Marie Tran getting bullied by toxic fans, so it's complicated.

\-Wrapping up a saga 42 years in the making. 

\-Changing directors as first Rian did 8 and Colin Trevvorow was going to direct 9 but didn't in the end (you can see some interesting concept art of what his version would have been). Imagine finishing your part on a big project then later being called back to do another big part. 

So I think he should be given a break and more appreciation should be given for what he did achieve.

It's my idea of what I would have loved to see episode 9 end. Here the full post:

One of the original ideas for the movies, was for that original trilogy and the prequels were actually a story being retold in the future. Hence the beginning, a ""Long Long time ago"". This was both meant for the viewers and as a plot point. One of the original titles for episode 4 was  *Journal of the Whills Part 1*. 

The plan was, a droid who survived from the Star Wars era (rise and fall of the Sith and the Empire) was retelling the story of the 'Star Wars' or ""the Journal of the Whills"" to a future society; and how the Sith gained power and were subsequently destroyed in the past. It is speculated this future civilization (100s or 1000s of years in the future) were experiencing a potential return of the Sith and wanted to better understand how this situation was dealt with in the past.

Lucas believed the droid who was telling this story was in fact, R2-D2. This is supported by the glorification of his accomplishments in the first six movies, and even making his best friend C3-PO seem foolish.

It also supports some of the dialogue choices, as it would make sense for a droid to think one could actually die ""of a broken heart"" (assuming you dont believe in the theory Sideous used Padme's life to keep Vader alive).

**I was secretly hoping this concept would be utilized in the 9th movie. Picture this Last scene:**

At then end of the movie, you see R2-D2 Projecting the last scene of the movie (as he did leia's message in 'A New Hope') onto a table. You see a metallic hand reach down and pat him on the head.

Mysterious Man: ""So that's how it all happened""

Mysterious Woman: ""Well then, what do we do now - the Jedi are long gone and no one has spoken of the force for hundreds of years.

Mysterious Man: We wait, there is one I know off who can help us. Although I dont think he has been heard from in around 900 years. His existence is merely a rumor....

(Flashback to a scene of a baby Yoda being taken care of by a man in Mandelorian Armor)

Mysterious Man:  And what happened next, my little droid friend?"" *R2's projector flash blue on the table and it cuts to a flash and then black.*

END MOVIE. (obviously im not a screenwriter, but you get the picture)

This also would allow Disney to begin a brand new trilogy with new characters new events that would use the Baby Yoda of the Mandelorian as the only new force user (as Yoda's species is know to live to about 1000 years old).

1. The Lightsabers
I think we all enjoyed some fights in The Sequels, they were awesome (especially Kylo Ren's combat style, damn he's good), but, the Lightsabers don't make any sense. In The OT and The Prequels, we saw lightsabers cutting through doors, cutting hands and heads off, they were unbeatable, only another lightsaber (or beskar) were able to deflect them. In The Sequels, Kylo hits Finn with his lightsaber in the back, he just fall unconscious. Rey hits Kylo in hid face with Anakin's lightsaber, it's just a flesh wound. Rey hits Praetorian Guards, it does nothing (Not to mention this whole fight scene in TLJ, what materials those guards have??)


2. Rey had zero training
We saw pretty early in TFA Rey using the force, the mind trick, and she had zero training. ""Oh but she's strong with the force"", you know who else were? Anakin Skywalker, he had more midi chlorians than Master Yoda, and still he needed to train for his whole life to be an awesome Jedi master. And yes, Luke had less training, but at least he had. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Luke wasn't able to do mind trick or use complicated force powers until ROTJ, and Rey used the freaking mind trick just because she tought ""Oh well I guess that's how this works let's try"". I guess First Order Stormtroopers have even weaker minds.


3. The Hyperspace 
We saw the hyperspace first in Star Wars Episode IV, the first movie. In history of SW, hyperspace is something that exists since The Old Republic or before (correct me if I'm wrong). And the concept of this is: The Hyperspace is not just travel very fast because that wouldn't be possible for multiple reasons (hitting things etc), so it's more of a worm hole thing, I wouldn't say alternate reality 'cause this is too much, but it's kinda. But in TLJ, this was broken, we see Holdo ""enter"" the hyperspace, and destroy a ship in the way. How does that make sense? If ""Entering the Hyperspace"" means, literally enter in some kind of worm hole, it's impossible to make this some sort of Tactical Attack to hit a ship, and of this was possible, why no one did this before her? TLJ broke this concept.


4. The Sith Holocron
Now, this is more of a expanded universe thing, since the Holocrons didn't appeared in any of the base movies, except IX (at least from what I remember). And they also work in a really simple way, you have a Sith Holocron, you must be, or at least think like a Sith to open it and access whatevers inside, same for a Jedi Holocron (This was shown In Rebels). But, In Episode IX, Kylo find this Sith Holocron in the middle of a forest after killing a bunch of random guys, the location of the thing is not really important, just wanted to mention this. And you think ""Oh he'll open it with the force 'cause it's a sith holo... oh"". He plugged the thing in his ship. What's the reason of making a Sith Holocron, to make this thing exclusive to Siths or Dark Side force users while anyone who has a ship and some cables can simply plug it in the ship and find it? This makes zero sense and it's one hell of inconsistencie with what was shown before.

While I find this ridiculous and a terrible idea, there are some who like the idea. So allow me to try to convince some of those people not to.

Remember the prequels? How they received similar hate from older Star Wars fans, but to a younger generation, they were the star wars they grew up with? That is exactly what Star Wars means to the newest generation of fans. They have their Kylo Ren figures standing with their Darth Vaders. While they love their Vaders and their Lukes, they also have an entirely new set of icons. Imagine tearing them from the story, these people who watched those characters grow . To them, that is their Star Wars. That should not be taken away. Yes, the erasing of legends was a mistake, but that mistake should not be repeated, it should be learned from. Build your own head-canon if you want, but don't ruin the films that people are growing up with.

While some things were undeniably poor choices from a character point of view, let's look at Luke in TLJ for an example, imagine if that one flashback was molded over the course of, say, a book, or a one-shot miniseries to tell the story of an old man who lost everything at the hands of a dictatorship see the return of that dictatorship in his own nephew as Luke struggles with the confusion, the grief and the remorse he feels in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the New Jedi Order. You could turn that butchering of a character into one of the greatest character studies and changes ever written, that explores the changing of a hopeful young man into a bitter, shame-filled old man.

Some people who grew up with the Original Trilogy hated the Prequels. But instead of pretending they never happened, the took those characters and told their own stories around the one they had been given (clone wars). What is needed is something similar, like an old Luke series following the outline set above, or a story as Rey struggles to build another Jedi order with practically no training, as she is helped by her friends and the force spirits of the past, as all eras unite to build a better future.

When a dog is born with no front legs, it shouldn't be shot. It should be helped, given prosthetics and so on. The sequels are the bottom of a pyramid of storytelling potential that builds up from bad quality to good. We have the opportunity for a new golden age of storytelling that unites all eras and characters. Just imagine a scene where Luke, Anakin, Obi-Wan and Ben all guide Rey, Finn and Poe towards a brighter future while learning from the mistakes of the past.

Sorry for any bad grammar, bad story ideas or anything that offends you, it's not intentional. Thank you for reading, I look forward to seeing any responses. Have a great day.

My question was like the title said, what’s the deal with boba fett’s helmet? He claims that the armour belongs to his father after confronting Din about taking it back on Tython. He even shows him at the end of the episode that it is in fact Jango Fett’s old armour as well in its history.

But in clone wars when boba was a kid he blew up Jango Fett’s helmet to attempt to kill Mace Windu? 

So my question is was this just retconned in the mandalorian, did he re forge the old destroyed helmet? Or did he just find another mandalorian helmet somewhere else and use that? Or any other possible ideas anyone might have.

He refers to his own past, regarding the Jedi with hatred for something they did to his family. He has an object with him, a cylinder with screaming faces etched into it that began to glow purple. Here's my theory on what that is. (This info is from Dooku: Jedi Lost)

Darth Krall was a former Jedi Master, a part of the Lost 20, with a bust likely located in the Jedi Archives. He became disillusioned with the Jedi way of life and left the Order at an unknown time (could have been centuries. This is the Jedi who likely hurt Marchion's family. It is said by Sifo-Dyas, that Krall took part in the ""Battle of Wasted Years"" in which he ""tamed the Nightmare Conjunction."" The ""battle of wasted years"" was likely what hurt Marchion's family, in which they viewed Krall as a Jedi (as he was before the event). His family learned about the Jedi and blamed them for the Battle, correlating Krall to the Jedi Order (which would be why Marchion knows so much). Eventually they took the Nightmare Conjunction (maybe they killed him?), before the Jedi arrived to take Krall's lightsaber. I don't know anything else about the Nightmare Conjunction or if it is the same thing. But Dooku: Jedi Lost has references to the High Republic (such as the bust of Trennis), so all of this was on the table during the development of LOTJ, so it's all very possibly related. 

TL;DR: The Jedi that hurt Marchion's family was Darth Krall (a part of the Lost Twenty), and the purple, cylinder object at the end of LOTJ that Marchion was holding is the Nightmare Conjunction.

Issue: The main issue with this theory was that the Sith were in hiding for a thousand years and the Jedi obtained Krall's lightsaber. If Krall lived over thousand years ago, why would Marchion's family continue to hold a grudge against the Jedi?",True,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1739476,public,spoiler,,,Theory regarding the LOTJ ending,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kwvoxy/theory_regarding_the_lotj_ending/,,all_ads,6,,,,b20976e8-77f0-11e9-880b-0e2f920ee9f0,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've loved Star Wars my whole life, and I think it did teach me how to be mindful of my emotions. There was also a 1-year period where I watched episode 1, EVERY DAY at some point in time. I know a lot of people who said they've watched the same movie on repeat as a child. My two were A Goofy Movie and The Phantom Menace.

The OT was always elusive to me though. I wanted to see them because I loved X-Wings. The first times I watched them were late at night on the sci-fi channel.  Ep IV and V came on at least a few times, but I never caught RotJ. 

Over time I became interested in other things and it fell out of my mind. I'd seen so many memes, and knew the outcome so clearly that I even convinced myself... 

""Yeah, I've probably seen it."" 

Oh lawd, was I wrong.  Lesgo!

Observations:

1. ""I think I enjoyed it more after seeing Anakin's ENTIRE arc, than I would have otherwise. ""

I remember watching the throne room scene of RotJ on YouTube in the past, and I remember thinking how  it felt bland by comparison to RotS and even ESB. The emotions didn't strike, because Darth is particularly emotive, and Luke is keeping his cool. The fighting does feel real and heavy, but they spend so much time talking and not saying much, that it felt... like a soundtrack? 

But I remember Anakin yelling, ""I hate you"", and I was thinking about how he's the same person in there. How he's leading his son to exactly the same fate he faced on on Mustafar, the Plan of the Emperor.  To hyper-traumatize someone into subservience. 

In one, singular day, take away everyone Luke/Anakin loved. Make him murder his father. Make him watch his friends die and fail. Leave him trapped inside Palpatine's deepest dungeon without hope and only regret, pain, and hate. Leave him with no one else who will take him.

In order to save the ones they love would need to kill their way forward. Something Luke was wary of and Anakin regretted in the end. 

The difference in their fates, was the choice Anakin made to save his son from the same fate. Ruling the galaxy together wasn't worth the pain and he'd learned that.

The way it parallels RotS's climax and conflict, I am convinced that Lucas held RotJ very close in his mind while making RotS.

""Palpatine has gotten sassy since order 66.""

One way I knew I'd never seen RotJ is because I'd never heard that man's dialogue before. Wow, what a funky treat that was. Throughout all the clone wars and prequels he is very eloquent. He speaks neatly, with neutral emotion, and fitting vocabulary. He's the head of government and acts like it, making sure not to offend or look weak. 

But wow, that cackling old man coming off the imperial shuttle was so hilariously bizarre. Towards the end of that scene, he's this senile sounding old man belly-laughing about trapping a random 20-something, in front of thousands of troops standing in perfect decorum, who all probably know nothing about this. 

Then every time anyone tries to talk to him, he immediately says random things about ""dark side stronk"" and ""it is all going to plan"", in the same pattern as a conspiracy theorist. He doesn't engage, he doesn't hold a conversation. He has like two kinds of responses. 

OH OH, AND I DIED WHEN LUKE SAID, ""I am a Jedi."" I can't imagine how pissed off Palpatine must have been hearing someone call themselves ""a jedi."" He looked so freaking mad. After such an extensive campaign and plot to kill literally every single jedi in the universe at the exact same time, who does Luke think he is? Palpatine killed four jedi masters with one beyblade spin attack. 

Palpatine has gotten a little weird in his time out of democratic politics.

Observation 3:
""Those Ewoks clowned on 'a legion of my best officers'. And what did I even watch?""

I've seen people describe this scene, and I knew the memes, but the actual scene sequence is flipping bananas. This is how it starts. 

Han and Leia are surrounded at the shield generator, about to be taken prisoner. A bunch of Ewoks then surround them and all the stormtroopers lose their got damn minds. Running in panic, fully routed in a single moment. This next part is important. 

It cuts to, and for about five seconds, an Ewok uses rocks and crude wooden traps to kill (and then presumably eat) stormtroopers. Then it cuts to a close up of some Ewoks either screaming in terror, or screaming because they are inflicting terror. And I mean, pretty close up. Highly stimulated Ewok faces filled what felt like 60% of the screen space for about five seconds.

This ten second pattern of scenes, first with traps, then Ewok faces, repeats itself for what feels like an hour. At one point in time, you see Chewbacca's face steal an AT-ST, and this one Ewok dies, but that's pretty much it. Despite all this, I was thoroughly entertained by all these practical effects and puppets beating up the galactic empire. 

That must have been a fun set to be on.

Conclusion: 
It was a great movie, and it was more than I expected in terms of being a satisfying climax and conclusion. I already knew the story, what happened before, what happened after, but wow.

The only problem being that he didn't expect 2 to show up and potentially endanger his plan. So he threw one of them down a hole hopefully deep enough so he wouldn't disrupt his plan. 
Afterwards he got to work destroying his own body, knowing that those machines wouldn't let him die naturally despite his body rotting away already, so he did the only thing he could and killed himself by having the only person currently stronger then him shoot his lightning back at him with the goal to disintegrate himself, which is why he kept firing lightning away. 
Having previously weakened Rey by sapping Kylo's and her strength, while at the same time strengthening himself, she was now weak enough to focus all her power on deflecting his strength, leaving an opening to slip though just like he said he would. 

 he/she started erasing the history of himself, taking the Skywalker name to make people trust him more easily, burying the lightsaber of the guy who killed him in that guy's most hated place, the sands of tatooine, and killing the last person strong enough to be a possible danger to him after sapping all of his strength away by playing dead.

That is very exciting for the sake of variety we may receive.

This also includes remakes as well as new games, I could see some classics like Republic Commando and Bounty Hunter being remade, probably not soon in lieu of new titles. Hopefully something may even happen with 1313.

Although I’m sure Disney will have majority control over every project, which is why I don’t expect big name developers like FromSoftware or Rockstar to take on making a Star Wars game, the potential is there and the first big news being an open world game is definitely exciting after The Mandalorian felt like a big game.

With that said, while I’m pleased that the EA death-grip on Star Wars games is over the news that they’re working with Ubisoft’s Massive Games was concerning. Massive had a hand in AC Revelations and Far Cry 3 supporting Ubisoft Montreal but I think that’s really the best of their career as a company. 

They’re main titles are ‘The Division’ and it’s sequel, both games aren’t considered that good as well as Ubisoft’s open-world games having their own issues and the worry of it being an Assassins Creed style game with a Star Wars skin on.

I’m cautiously optimistic about them taking on this project but since it’s confirmed open-world it would be interesting take for a modern Star Wars game.

Overall I’m mixed with this news but I’m please with the potential on the table if the non-exclusivity route is taken.

I believe if Abrams was given a new movie, with brand new characters, he would do good.

With TFA Abrams had to do fan service and reintroduce fan favorite characters from decades ago. In addition to dealing with Harrison Ford’s request for Han Solo’s death in the film.

TROS Abrams had to implement the characters arcs from TLJ which bogged down the movie. Like having to resolve the Rose arc and now not having Snoke in his plan.

Edit: Carrie Fisher’s death also impacted TROS, which impacted what Abrams was able to do for the film.

But literally just today they announced that Ubisoft is making a Star wars game and open the world Star wars game all we can find about it is that the guys who made the division series is going to be a part of it but we don't know for how much at least that's what I've been seeing my opinion this is a good idea because Star wars has done everything that the shooter strategy simulations there's a lot of stuff they've done but they didn't do your shooters or open what games as far as I can tell unless you count RPGs in the MMOs which I don't because all RPGs and MMOs are open worldish and honestly I'm happy about it let me explain.

if you remember a while back we were going to get like some fancy Star wars game beep like the guys from Dead space I think and they were going to have some open world bounty Hunter game but canceled because they were taken too much time and with they're exclusivity license ending in 2023 they're outsourcing the games to other companies and I believe Ubisoft is the best one we got right now sure not a lot of people like assassin's Creed nowadays especially after the change in my opinion they are good changes and I know for a fact not a lot of people are fan of the division series but if I haven't choose I would pick Ubisoft because they would be the ones that be the most willing to accept it

I'll explain it like this if rockstar got the chance to make a Star wars game I'm pretty sure they would say no to it actually because they would possibly be limit themselves to a t rating which I don't think they would have mine because of bully but They would say no also because they would have to make it fit within the canon of the films and rockstar are loves to have full creativity which explains like why they're both developer and the publisher of their games and I'm saying this now though GTA V I love the thing I don't think the side of GTA or red Dead redemption could work in a Star wars game well GTA I could see working but not as well and I just think Rockstar already has a bunch of stuff on our play with the whole multiplayer GTA V red Dead redemption online and the rumored bully 2 and GTA VI but who knows maybe they'll accept it if they got the chance

I know some people that still say CDPR (CD project red) should have a Star wars title I'm telling you now though I was fucking love that I am also terrified if they ever do because of everything that happened with cyberpunk then also they're apparently working on multiplayer for cyberpunk which is security The DLC for cyberpunk and after all that they're going to start with The Witcher 4 basically even if cyberpunk wasn't the disaster that I was they would have said no because of their hands are very full in the very very busy and I'm not even going to talk about Bethesda because well they're making an Indiana Jones game so there's that

In conclusion I'm happy about Ubisoft making a Star wars game is this technically them whoring out the franchise Yes but unlike other games and stuff I think it's a smart business strategy they're possibly going to a bunch of developers and going hey you want to make a Star wars game and if they do well like who knows maybe the Bethesda Indiana Jones game might be amazing and we're going to get them to do a Star wars project but ubisoft's game will crash and burn and no one else will touch it I'm basically saying is it's a good way to show what companies they would keep and companies they would not keep because they do not want another EA fiasco and I bet you if phone order and bathroom too didn't have a insanely big fan base I bet you five bucks they would be kicked right out the door but since people like battlefront 2, falling order and squadrons to an extent including methey're going to keep them for those games exclusively 

maybe this will be a call of duty thing and they'll have like 1 years going to have a EA game or the other's going to be a Ubisoft all the others of Bethesda and maybe ones from Activision I don't know I'm just hoping this doesn't end with another dumbass fan war",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1738743,public,self,,,Ubisoft's making a Star wars game at least it's not EA,0,[],0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kwnjrb/ubisofts_making_a_star_wars_game_at_least_its_not/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Light side represents all that is good and righteous in the force and the dark side is a subversion of the force that causes an imbalance and results in death and destruction for a lot of people.

This was the basis of the Star Wars: the forces of good (Jedi) vs the forces of evil (Sith) but after reading and watching the expanded media from both the canon and legends media I have noticed that the whole thing isn't as black and white as it seems. Don't get me wrong I love the conflict between the Jedi and Sith as much as the next fan, but has anyone considered how to end the conflict for good or at least find a solution to maintain the balance and minimize the damage when the force is imbalance? I have a few ideas on how to solve this but before we go into that let's examine some of the flaws of both the Sith and the Jedi.

For starters the dark siders, the Sith, suffered from chronic backstabbing disorders and were so blinded by their own arrogance, greed, and pride that they were incapable of working with others and making practical decisions to maintain their control over the galaxy. For example, when Palpatine created the Empire he deliberately promoted in-fighting and humocentrism for his own amusement instead of taking measures to stabilize the Empire and prevent its destruction. Then in ROFTJ and ROF he made poorly calculated decisions that led to his own demise and destroyed everything he built like leaking information on the Death Star's shield generator and removing the element of surprise by revealing the final order. Basically the main weakness of the Sith is that they grab the Villain Ball so much that they are unable to develop a long lasting power base and cooperate and compromise with others.

As for the Jedi they too have weaknesses that are just as bad as the Sith's. By the time of the ""prequel era"" they had become complacent in their belief that the Sith were wiped out forever. This mindset is what made them reject Qui-gon's claims of Darth Maul and eventually they had become arrogant enough to presume that they were always, **ALWAYS** in the right and they refused to acknowledge when they had made a mistake like presuming that Ahsoka Tano was guilty and refusing to apologize for it chalking it up as a test of the force. In addition they had become so mired in galactic politics that they were unable to take the necessary actions to stop the Sith conspiracy. In summary the Jedi Order of this era can be best summed up as  and I quote ""nothing more than an extension of the Galactic Republic and its members were a bunch of self-rightious ascetics and monks that really only acted as agents of the Galactic Republic. They were more concerned with keeping in the good graces of the Galactic Republic and helping it to endure."" ( Star wars -- the Jedi Order, TV Tropes).

Furthermore, there are also some other practices of the Jedi that raise more than a few eyebrows. The most controversial was the induction of children and babies into the order, because the Jedi believed that those who haven't had a lifetime of jedi training will turn to the dark side. This ultimately proved detrimental to one's upbringing because those who grew up in the order usually ended up being unable to handle larger society and making complex moral decisions, with Kanan and Ahsoka being prime examples. Additionally the Jedi were forbidden from making emotional attachments with friends and family.  They believed that attachments with others would lead towards the dark side, so they raised members of the order to have few attachments with others and to remain distant and aloof from larger society. In the end however the Jedi who had few to no emotional attachments either turned towards the dark side (Ex: Bariss, Dooku, Krell) or grew-up as arrogant and self-righteous as the other members of the Order, with some notable exceptions (Ex: Yoda, Ahsoka, Obi-wan, Kanan, etc.). Finally, the Jedi Order barely interacts with the general public and because they do very little PR or take actions to ease the suffering of those caught in the crossfire (Ex: the Martez Sisters parents), these have led many people to develop negative preconceptions of the Jedi seeing them as either warmongers, child-stealers, reckless heroes, or stooges of the republic. Bottomline, while the Jedi are the ultimate good guys in Star Wars they are far from the perfect heroes some people make them out to be, with their main flaws being their own hubris, their reactive stance towards galactic threats like the Sith, their refusal to connect with others on an emotional level, and their indifference towards the general public's opinion towards them.

Now that the flaws of both the Jedi and the Sith are listed here are some ideas I have been able to come up with on how to correct these flaws and end all the strife caused by the two factions. Two of them I think will be able to maintain the balance in the force and the last one is the only option I have been able to come up with to end the war. All of these options have pros and cons I have identified. If anyone has any other ideas on how to end the war between the Jedi and the Sith or maintain the balance in the force please feel free to comment.

**Option 1: Create two separate orders for both the light and dark side respectively.**

Description: So in this scenario the Jedi, the Republic and the Sith sign a peace treaty dividing their jurisdiction of the galactic territories that they can operate in. Basically the Jedi would be limited to operating in territories under the Republic and the Sith would be limited to operating in territories within their Empire. Both would be able to operate freely within territories that are not part of the Republic or Empire but they would not interfere in each other's operations. In addition both orders would initiate reforms to ensure their survival, the Jedi would allow their members to pursue emotional attachments and end the practice of recruiting children, and the Sith would allow alien members to join their ranks and end the chronic backstabbing that was rampant amongst their kind by passing a set of rules similar to the rule of the One Sith from Star Wars: Legacy.

Pros: In the short-term, the galaxy would be able to find some peace and both orders would be able to check the power of species that seek the enslavement of others like the Hutts and the Grysk, and stop outlaw groups like the Zygerrian Slavers, and Death Watch from preying on the innocent.

Cons: However, if one abides by George Lucas interpretation of the force (Balance of the force, both mawinstallation and Star Wars subreddits) this would not be able to work out in the long-term, because the Dark Side is the subversive part of the force that wacks everything out of balance. So it would only be a matter of time before the Jedi and the Sith start fighting again.

**Option 2: Create one order that meshes certain aspects of Jedi and the Sith together.**

Description: So in this scenario a new order is created that finds a balance between ""the Jedi's discipline and the Sith's passion"". These guys would include practices like force users being able to start families and having kids, and encouraging some Jedi to be self-educated and be open to all types of opinions/philosophies and not just follow regimented dogma and training. In addition older members would be recruited as well and trained and the practice of recruiting children/babies and indoctrinating them will end, with certain exceptions (Ex: orphans, kids who live in a bad environment, kids who live in a troubled household).

Any initiates who cannot complete their training or are leaning too much to the dark side by exhibiting traits of pride and arrogance. would instead work in the Service Corp. In the Jedi Order the Service Corp was a group created by the Council for Jedi Initiates who failed to pass their trials. The Corp mission was to help citizens through humanitarian services (Agric. Corps, Medical Corps, EduCorps) and they supported space exploration and scientific research into new alien species and cultures (ExplorCorps.). However under the Jedi most members of the Corps were looked down upon as dropouts and slackers and didn't receive as much support and recognition as they could have. Under the new order the Service Corps would gain more support from the order and would be used to foster goodwill and trust between the order and the general public and provide relief to citizens that are caught in the crossfire between light and dark or are just down on their luck and need help. In addition members of the service corp are allowed to retake the trials and knights are obligated to do Service Corp work either on a part-time or if they want on a full-time basis.

As far as relations with the Republic go the New Order will agree to help and protect the ""people of the Republic"", but they won't become mired in the bureaucratic redtape as their predecessors and they will keep their distance from Republic politics.  The only exceptions will be the Republic Diplomatic Corp and the Republic military. Both of these organizations will have force-user liasion officers to assist them. When working with the Diplomatic Corp the order will assist the organization by acting as mediators and diplomats and help the Corp handle internal/external disputes. When working with the Republic military the order will assist the military with handling threats with outlaws and pirates and the will also serve as medics for military personnel, but other than that they will mostly avoid getting directly involved in military affairs and battles and their main focus will be on the protection of civilians and helping them in anyway they can.

In addition the Order would obtain indirect financial support from the Republic through funds from the budget that is allocated to the Ministry of State, and the Ministry of Defense, who control the Diplomatic Corp and the Republic military respectively. These ministries will use their budgets to pay the Order for their time and services to their agencies. They will also receive donations from the Force worshippers, wealthy donors like the San Tekka clan and other nobility, and the private accounts of members who are a part of wealthy families. But at least over half of their revenue will come from the investments made by an internal agency called the Economic Bureau.  These guys will help the order generate revenue through the private sector through investments in stocks and bonds, assisting merchant fleets with charting new routes, buying and selling real-estate, and loans from the banks.

In terms of jurisdiction the Jedi will only operate in Republic territory, and they won't interfere in the affairs' of non-republic territories and planets unless they are asked by them or if they suspect a darksider is manipulating events on these worlds like Maul or the Bando Gora.

Finally, to prevent the dark side from upsetting the balance in the force the New Force Order will have an organization called the Watchcircle. Similar to the Jedi Covenant this organization is devoted to stopping the threat of the Sith and the emergence of another Sith War from breaking out across the galaxy by any means necessary. Basically they would act as the eyes and ears of the order and would keep an eye out for any dark-side threats in the galaxy be it dark-side force users like the Nightsisters and the Sith. They will also act as the internal affairs group for the Jedi Order to keep any eye on Jedi that are leaning towards the dark side of the force. This way the New Order would be able to stop the Sith from disrupting the balance in the force or at least be able to prepare the galaxy for it.

Note: I am avoiding using the term Jedi to describe this order because I want to come up with an original name for this force order that hasn't been used before. I am also trying to avoid the term ""grey Jedi"" because that is very unpopular among certain aspects of the Star Wars fandom.

Pros: Unlike the PT Jedi this New Order will be much more open and tolerant of new ideas and force philosophies rather than just following one dogma. This Order will be model itself off the teachings of the prime Jedi and will recognize that they do not own the force and whether they like it or not the dark side will try to come back so defeating it for good is impossible. All they can do is find ways to mitigate the damage caused by the imbalance. Also unlike the PT Jedi the New Order will not be as entangled in Republic Politics and will be more focused on protecting and helping the citizens of the galaxy and maintaining the balance in the force. In addition the Order will work towards improving public relations with galactic citizens and will do everything in their power to help and protect them. Furthermore the Watchcircles will keep an eye out for an disturbances in the force and do everything in their power to stop them or prepare the Order and the Republic for war.

Cons: There are a few drawbacks to this model with the main one being giving Jedi the ability to have interests and desires. Maintaining the balance isn't easy and if they Jedi become too arrogant or too attached to their loved ones there is a good chance that they could go to the dark side of the force (which is also a common complaint among fans who dislike grey Jedi). In addition if the Order becomes too complacent there is a good chance that they could slide into the stance of the PT Jedi and become as prideful and entitled as they were. And then there is the issue of the Watchcircles. While they might sound like a good idea in theory that doesn't make them any less susceptible to the dark side. In legends a group of Jedi called the Covenant had the same idea but they failed in their mission and a lot of innocent people ended up dying because of their actions. And they may not always be successful in which case millions if not trillions may still end up dying from a Jedi-Sith war because of the Watchcircles failure to stop them in time.

**Option 3: Destroy the Force.**

Description: So this is the only option that I could think of that could permanently end the war between the Jedi and the Sith. In case you haven't already figured it out I got the idea from the star of KOTOR 2 Kreia. Kreia believed that the force was nothing more than a manipulative god that enjoyed getting its kicks from watching the Jedi and Sith beat the shit out of each other over and starting wars that killed trillions in the process. In order to stop this Kreia believed that the force had to die and that way everyone would be free from the cycle of violence caused by the endless conflict between the two factions. While it does sound extreme if you have read or watched post-ROFTJ media from both Legends and Canon she might have a point. (Note: Although to be fair if you look at the Canon Sequel Trilogy from a doylist view all those people who ended up dying in the galaxy was a result of recycling stuff from the OT). And if you think people in the galaxy can't live without a connection to the force that is untrue because there are some people like the Jedi Exile, another KOTOR II star, who are able to live without the force.

Honestly I am not even sure how this could be done but if it were possible then the Sith and Jedi will fade from existence and the galaxy would have to find a way to move on without them, which in all honesty shouldn't be too hard considering the entire galaxy has always been apathetic towards both the Jedi and the Sith regardless of which continuity they are from.

Pros: If such a thing were possible there are a few positives with getting rid of the force. For one thing without the Force the Jedi and the Sith will be unable to wage their wars across the galaxy at least not on the level they were on in the movies. Furthermore, people would finally be free to choose their own destiny instead of having some cryptic entity having their fate decided for them.

Cons: On the other hand if such a thing were to happen it may end up being the worse thing to happen in galactic history. If such a thing were to happen life throughout the galaxy may experience a mass withdrawal and this might cause a lot of the chaos and suffering that Kreia was trying to avoid. And this is just worse case scenario. Even if this doesn't happen there is a good chance that without the Sith other factions like the Hutt Cartel, the Zygerrian slavers, the Grysk, and others will try to fill the void they left behind and start preying on the innocent. And this time there won't be an order of Jedi Knights to stop them. Bottomline there are too many unknown to make this a sure-fire solution.

Note to the moderators: I'm not trying to complain or be salty I'm just trying to find a solution to end an endless conflict.

Even though earlier in the film before the Sidious scene, with the Probes on Hoth, I’m pretty sure he says “Skywalker” by name. 

Then there’s also that comic that was released recently. After the first Death Star blew up, The Empire wanted to know more about the young pilot who was responsible. Then, Boba Fett interrogates Luke’s friends on Tatooine, and they give him the name “Skywalker”. He then reports to Vader, who is clearly surprised by this.

My dream Star Wars Game would be an open world rpg game where you could travel to multiple planets. I’d want it to be online mainly and have many side quests and a option main story path that changes with your decisions (basically everyone’s story would be different). You’d be able to choose where you are from, if you’re force sensitive or not, if you’re balanced or leaning on one side, be able to customize your character (and enough to look different than everyone else), etc. 

Now the biggest things I hate about Star Wars games is the combat it’s either too easy and looks clunky or like bf2 it took skill but overall still looks a little clunky and not cool. Not sure if anyone has played but the game For Honor had one of the best combat systems in my opinion. It never looked clunky and you actually needed a lot of skill to play. For anyone who didn’t play you would lock onto the enemy holding down the L2 button and you would use your right analog stick to pick which direction to hit or defend from the players attacks. I think this would work so perfectly in a Star Wars game! Just imagine! You’d actually need some skill to use the mechanics and it’d be super cinematic just like a real movie duel!

Now if you were to use that system for fighting I’d love for you to be able to change your attacks as you progress for example in the For Honor game you had a light attack and a strong attack and each attack was a little different looking depending on which direction you’d chose. So let’s say you were a level 1 you’d have your basic new attacks and then you progress to let’s say level five you could learn a new right, hard attack so instead of a basic swing of the saber you could have a swing or twirl and it could be a little faster as well, that way a low level Jedi would have no match for a high level sith (it wouldn’t be impossible but very difficult). 

Idk lmk what you guys think! 

Little extra things I’d like too:
- being able to buy a ship
- face tracker thing to show your expressions on screen
- Gigantic selection of clothing
- needing to actually pay and go see someone to fix any lost limbs or wounds 
- having only one life if you die you did and must make a new character (this is my own thing I know others don’t like it always but i feel like your character would be a lot more meaningful.)
- better mic technology for example if you’re far away from someone they can’t hear you or if you are close you are able to hear them yada yada
- being able to rise to power even leading the empire or rebellion (for more serious competitive players
- learning new force powers and choosing which ones you’d have equipt
- learning how to block blaster fire

Guess what Lucasfilm just announced!

Before that I made a post arguing for why Mace Windu should come back and a little bit after rumors started that would happen fueled by the twitter post to SLJ on his birthday.

I am a motherlovin prophet! Lucasfilm future creative director coming at you.

In 2014 I said Disney shouldn't make movies first and that their future would be TV shows, books and games and that they should wait for the success of those before doing a new trilogy.

So I just want to put my list of future predictions. Some are obvious and some are longshots but I just want to record them so I can gloat about them later.

Remaster of Knights of the old republic and Kotor 2. (2022)

We won't get a Mace windu show but we might get a cameo possibly in Jedi Fallen Order 2 followed by something live action

We won't be seeing the last of Mark Hamill as Luke. He will meet Ahsoka in her show and she will help him start the new Jedi Order but will be focused on her own mission of saving Ezra and fighting Thrawn. Ezra will then be one of Lukes jedi instructors. 

Disney will retcon parts of the sequel movies with the biggest retcon being that Kylo Ren/Snoke did not destroy all the Jedi and that enough survived to restart the Order.

Thrawn in live action will knock it out of the park and become the franchises best villain. After his debut its going to be Thrawn thrawn thrawn splatted all over youtube and reddit.

Things I'd like to see (not a prediction): 

A game set in the sequel era with Rey in a Tomb Raider/Uncharted style adventure game. Naughty Dog should make this game

A Knight of Ren survived and becomes the new big bad force user. He's not a sith tho. The Knights of Ren will seek revenge against the Jedi just like the Sith did except they will do it out in the open as warriors.

Knights of the Old Republic 3

Knights of the High Republic

Republic Commando remake (this was a first person shooter from the LucasArts era of gaming)

Republic Commando: Bad batch

Imperial Commando sequel to Republic Commando (you play as either death or purge troopers during Order 66)

Rebel Commando sequel to Imperial Commando

A new version of Sam Witwers Galen Starkiller. Call him Galen Katarn and put him as a post sequel second generation Jedi along with Reys twins aka the Skywalker twins and Finns son a second generation Jedi. (Movies and games)

Mass Effect style RPG based around the twins. 

Action RPG based around Galen Katarn

Grogu is a recurring character in these games and novels

I am not going to bother getting into defending the sequels because it isn't even the point, for all I care, I hate them.

For one, the Prequels were never erased. They were arguably more hated than the Sequels. The Prequels were reviled, the Sequels were merely divisive in comparison, well being people started to fully notice it's flaws. But, It's absolutely batshit to suggest Disney will erase Episodes VII, VIII and IX, films they themselves own and created because of fan backlash.

Secondly, every theory of this braindead idea stems from TWBW. Except TWBW doesn't even change the timeline. At all.

I started thinking of how I could do it better. What would I do if I conquered the galaxy?

1. Don't try and rule with fear. There's billions of planets with billions of people each, you can't hope to intimidate them all.
2. People are easier to rule if they want to be ruled. Invest in things that make people *want* to be a part of your Empire.
3. Before building a gigantic planet-killing battlestation, I will see if there is anything else that could use the money, such as urban renewal, shelters and food banks for the poor, easy access to education and healthcare, that kind of thing.
4. The people who design my gigantic planet-killing battlestation will be a different group to the people who build my gigantic planet-killing battlestation.
5. After the designs for my gigantic planet-killing battlestation are completed, they will be reviewed by an independent board to make sure that there are no weaknesses in the design.
6. After my gigantic planet-killing battlestation has been constructed, it will be reviewed by an independent board, to make sure that it has been constructed properly and no weaknesses have crept into the design, no corners cut, etc.
7. My stormtroopers will be provided with armor that actually protects them, rather than mass-produced garbage.
8. The marksmanship exam at the stormtrooper academy will be a live fire exercise (albeit with stun rounds). Anybody who cannot score above 50% will not be allowed to graduate.
9. When not actively engaged in combat, stormtroopers must spend at least two hours a day on the shooting range. Anybody who cannot score above 50% will be removed from active duty and given a refresher course on how to shoot properly. Persistent violations will result in them being discharged.
10. My bases will have regular checkpoints, not just at the entrances and exits, where people are required to present their IDs. Also, random stop and search checks will be carried out.
11. My fighter pilots will be provided with ships that have at least a bare minimum of shielding
12. When not actively engaged in combat, fighter pilots must spend at least two hours a day on the orbital practice course, under the same rules as point 9.
13. Point defense turrets must actually provide point defense.
14. People wishing to become commanders must display a knowledge of proper battle tactics before being promoted.
15. Slavery will be abolished. All workers must be given at least minimum wage, and can only work a certain amount of hours a week. Minimum wage will be higher in dangerous jobs, and working hours shorter. Functional PPE will be provided for dangerous jobs.
16. If people do rebel against my Empire, I will come down on them harshly, but fairly, and they will be punished proportionately to their crimes.
17. If I'm going to execute rebels, make sure they are actually rebels first.
   1. No mass executions of innocent civilians to try and draw out the rebels. Nothing will turn the population against you faster.
   2. Execute ONLY the rebels. If their families and friends didn't do anything wrong, they don't deserve to be punished.
18. If I build a fleet of Star Destroyers equipped with Death Star lasers, I will install a surge protector between the main reactor and the laser. That way, the entire ship won't explode if somebody gets in a lucky shot.
19. My Empire will not be humans-only
20. I will set up an interplanetary exchange program, where people can go and live with aliens and experience their culture, to try and promote interspecies integration
21. Force-sensitives will not be forcibly recruited or killed. Instead, I will set up a Force Corps that they can join, with good wages, healthcare and pension package, benefits, and their whole family will be taken care of, to encourage people to join up.
22. If I create some awesome new tech, such as a Siege Dreadnought, people must demonstrate that they can use it effectively before being given command of it.
   1. For future reference, the correct order is: shoot the cruisers first to stop them escaping, THEN destroy the base to stop them retreating, then destroy the transports if your escort ships haven't done so already.
23. Don't blow up an entire fuel dump just to take out one person.
24. If I want to set up a trap for the rebels that involves using my gigantic planet-killing battlestation as bait, I will finish building the aforementioned battlestation first, so that there aren't any holes in the side that the rebels can fly through to blow up the main reactor.

Almost like a halo wars game but done with more detail like civilization. You’d be able to make alliances or declare wars or trade routes.

You can even start the game at a primitive age and have to research to discover hyperdrives, shields, blaster tech, etc. Instead of “religions” it could be something like “force knowledge” where you have temples that people study the force, you’d be Able to decide if you want your civilization to focus on using the force, if so dark, light or a combination and that could unlock new troops/technology. Idk there would be so much potential and I think it could be a cool idea if done well.

Not to mention the potential for dlc’s since companies love those cash grabs. As long as the base game is filled out enough and balanced there is endless content that could be added from legends or even just only using cannon. They could have a whole Hutt expansion that focuses on running a criminal syndicate in the outer rim, while actively avoiding larger civilizations such as the GAR, and trading with allies to grow your organization.

A primitive dlc of Wookiees would be awesome, you’d be able to control the technologically advanced Wookiees while defending your home world from invading civilizations and establishing alliances with others for mutual growth.

Today I would like to discuss how mandalore was already doomed to fall under dutchess satine long before maul or deathwatch got involved using real world history and economics.

First let me define the way the new mandalorians ran mandalore.

From what i gather Mandalore under dutchess satine was a socialist monarchy. 
I would call them socialist as dutchess satine often references things like government rations, and socialized healthcare, and all businesses on some level have direct government influence.
And they appear to be a monarchy as there was no reference to an election ever being held on mandalore except for the prime minister similar to how real world England works.

The combination of these two things is not a recipe for a well running government as under a socialist society it is easy for people to feel stagnant due to overregulation if not directly accounted for.
And since the person who is supposed to account for that is royalty, and royalty are more often than not out of touch as satine clearly is.

I believe that this combination of things is what caused the rampant corruption under dutchess satine. Without the freedom to earn additional resources by working hard people resorted to illegal black market deals in order to move up in society.

This also explains why so many people followed the prime minister's orders in direct violation of satines orders as i would imagine most people would be more loyal to who they put in power.

That explains the corruption but not how mandalore was doomed to fall, after all we've seen more corrupt  governments during the clone wars that didn't fall until the rise of the empire such as the techno union.

The problem is that on top of instilling resentment in the mandalorian people the new mandalorian government is a pacifist one which doesn't appear to have lethal consequences for any infraction no matter how severe as evident by the mandalorian police's use of stun weapons even when dealing with armed criminal organizations.

While it is tyrannical  to excerxise flamboyant use of force on a population as we see the empire do regularly a certain amount of force is necessary to ensure the security of your people.

As such the new mandalorian government had a reputation for weakness amongst systems outside of mandalore and even within their own people, the clone wars certainly didn't help this reputation.

All of these factors set up mandalore as being weak, unstable and resentful of the existing government. Or in other words a perfect place to conquer if that's what you're after.

Based on this it was only a matter of time before someone took over mandalore even if the deathwatch never formed, and maul never took interest in the planet.

This time I was determined because I wanted to understand all the backstory from certain characters from The Mandalorian S2, suffered through the film, and I’m honestly taken aback at the jump in quality in just Season 3. Per the chronological order after the movie I watched Ep 301, ‘Clone Cadets’, and I absolutely adored it. I finally felt like I was understanding the immense love this show gets from this community that I felt left out of before. This was just a 20 something minute story with no Jedi action, no Bounty Hunters, no known characters at all except a B tier Jedi in a non action role, and only one location, but I found it as compelling as any other solid Star Wars story. Emotional payoff and well written, mature conflicts between characters we hadn’t met before, all digging into the backstory of the Clones more and their training on Kamino. It was brilliant. 

I also watched the following episode 302 ‘Supply Lines’ which was next in the Chrono Order and that was very good too, didn’t expect a certain couple of deaths that happened and it was quite emotional. The music was great too, just high quality everything and a genuine jump in quality of all departments from the film and S1/2.

In the same timeline, yoda is part of it until 4 aby, maybe sooner. How are people remembering the civil war that's way long ago but have no clue about grogus species, doesn't seem long ago that yoda was a major part of history.

Also in ROTS, when Obi-Wan confronts Padme before he sneaks on the ship to go to Mustafar. The dialogue, the denial from Padme, the AMAZING music swelling, and Obi-Wan ending it with “Anakin is the father, isn’t he? I’m so sorry.” GETS ME EVERY TIME....

He has also mentioned that the Rebels epilogue may be set after the timeline of The Mandalorian. Therefore, it's also possible that the epilogue is set after The Mandalorian.

In the Clone Wars S7 ending we see Ahsoka in a grey robe and in the Rebels epilogue she has a white robe. This is very much an intentional detail and we see the start and end of this arc for her character in those epilogues. Gandalf the Grey became Gandalf the White after he died and was sent back to finish his quest. This leads me to believe that something similar will happen to Ahsoka but on a spiritual level and I think the Ahsoka series will focus on this rebirth, which will end the arc for ""Ahsoka the Grey"". How this will happen, I'm not sure but I have a hunch it will have at least something to do with a Skywalker.

I will not go into the details of Gandalfs rebirth as many of you already know them but essentially he died but was (very surprisingly) sent back with a greater power and wisdom by Eru himself. Ahsoka still feels guilt and pain over Anakin and these are in my opinion the feelings that hold her down. For example, I think she refused to train Grogu purely out of personal fears (although she might not have realized this).

IF Filnoi is Involved it must be default good. you know how many times ive heard fans criticize something in the franchise only to later backtrack on those same critiques the moment you point out Filoni falling into the same pitfalls.

Regardless though, I have no problem with People Praising Filoni but it's always done in a way that completely strips away credit from other creators that have put in just as much work and get very little recognition. In fact some of the best Clone Wars Arcs are not even Directed or written by Filoni.

A series with so many creatives involved requires a great deal of collaborate effort to get things to run smoothly...

With that id like to highlight some writers that have contributed a great deal to the Clone Wars being an outstanding Show.

I think he's the best character in the entire series(movies, tv shows etc)(imo).
A big personal issue for me is how they just did a full maul storyline in the cartoon series and not the movies or in a series something like mando'.
Maul is such a better topic/story/storyline than this other stuff imo. But they can't do it now because the cartoon series did it and they did it pretty terribly. Imagine how much better it could have been if they did it like a 3 movie set or did a series like the mandolorian. 
And what annoys me even more is how Maul was brought for as a new character in Phanton Menace and then killed off. Like this is such a badass character and they just kill him off. Imagine watching lord of the rings and in the first hour you get introduced to Gandalf and then an hour later hes killed. Or if in the Harry Potter series they present Dumbledore and kill him off half way through the first movie. 

I've seen the cartoon series and I know if what they presented in those cartoons are done or were done in a movie(but better) or even in a series like the Mandolorian it would have been a hit. 
Its like one of the best characters of this series has been forgotten about.

Here's a wacky order inspired by the Machete Order but with everything...

R1, 4, 5, 1, 2, TCW, 3, Rebels, Solo, 6, Mando, 7, 8, Resistance, 9

A few notes about why I laid it out this way...

* So Luke is our lens into this world so to speak, but R1 is a perfect place to starts because it outlines the overarching conflict here, plus you can end R1 and start 4 without skipping a beat.
* Luke starts his adventure and then finds out that Vader is his father in 5. So imagine Ben Kenobi sits him down and tells him all the stories about Anakin in the prequels and TCW show. *(I know that Ben admits to the truth being a certain 'point of view' in 6, but work with me on this)*
* It's also possible that Luke discovers more about The Rebel Alliance in it's early years during this time which is where rebels comes in. But Rebels is also useful because he learns more stories about Vader and Palpatine during this time.
* We just met Lando in 5, so it would be fitting for Chewie to tell Luke and Leia how he met Han and Lando, and became friends. They probably had some downtime in the years it took them to work up the courage to rescue Han. Watching Solo brings it all back to Han, because when we start 6 next, that's who we're going to rescue.
* So with all this knowledge of the Rebels, the Jedi, Vader/Anakin, Palpatine, the Sith, we come into 6 as wise as Luke is. All the moments lead up to the final battle in 6 on Endor, in space, and in the throne room.
* Having the Mando show after makes sense because it's clearly building towards the sequel trilogy. More shows like Asohka, Book of Boba, and Rangers, will go in this space before 7 I'm sure. Something like Acolyte (set in High Republic era) will be a little harder to place.
* Sequel trilogy will be in its order, with Resistance in between 8 and 9. Resistance is a weird one because it has episodes placed throughout the sequel trilogy but ends as a lead-up to 9.

This order also works if you just want to watch the movies. 

Some of the new shows and movies announced might complicate this, but I'm sure it can be reworked and rearranged to accommodate it all.

Knowing our heroes like Cassian + Jyn will die in the end still doesn’t hold me back from liking these characters while they are there. I really feel their death at the end of the film. Same with Chirrut, Baze, and of course K-2SO.

Compelling story with the Death Star and how the flaw was placed. Krennic while I can’t stand him (obviously the point) it is cool how the weapon he created eventually killed him, at the hands of Tarkin.

PERFECT amount of Vader in the film. Of course the incredible scene at the end but seeing him on Mustafar in the bacta tank + talking with Krennic was incredible as well.

Beautifully shot. So many amazing visuals.

I don’t get the “2/3 was bad, 1/3 was great” narrative. I was fully engaged the entire time and was enjoying everything. Even better the third time around.

Don’t be mad please, my questions are not meant to be offensive , and you’re the best place to ask them.

1-is there a rule for the color of the sabers among the jedi? Red is Sith ok. But inside the Jedi?

2-Why are the Jedi so worshipped? They only do fail after fail:
-Kwaigon dies quickly and fails his promise to train anakin. 
-Obi wan fails his training of anakin when he knew it was the chosen one. Why did he not ask for more people to train him? Why did the Jedi train him like anyone else? Obi is average so not the best choice right? Seems weird. 
-Windu fails to act appropriately when anakin tells him that palpatin is bad and goes without a proper army + goes quickly dark by trying to kill palpatin
-Yoda saiys quickly “I fail” after ... what .. falling from a senate seat? And is like “ok I failed, I’m going to hide now. Deal with the shit alone”???? Seriously??
-no Jedi could sense palpatin dark force this whole time? Nor doku’s force? What?
-the Jedi are super bad at psychology too: they sense anger in anakin and... make him angrier by treating him in a patronizing way? Seriously?
-no Jedi could sense the force in Padre belly? If they sense a variation in the force when someone dies, why not when someone is created?
-obi wan is a freaking sadist to let a man burn to death. Is this what the jedi way teaches???

Also why o why do they send the baby Luke on the very planet of his dad? Surely there is a better more remote planet. Yoda says “we hide him where no one will find him”  so... exactly where I would look for in the first place? I mean, Darth Vader having mommy and daddy issues, he could have the idea to visit his uncle no?

Does that make sense to you? Because to me it does not really.

I’ll keep plot points vague so as not to spoil.

====================================

The first entry into the next era of Star Wars kicks off in a very exciting way in this book. After so much emphasis in the era of the Skywalker Saga, adjusting your brain to new names set in some new and some familiar places will be key to enjoy this book.

What I loved about this book is the imagery it weaves between each pages—and how the pacing works. I’m sure it’s intensional, but this book is written like a movie, separating certain parts within  chapters to jump between the subject in that scene, be it one of the new heroes, Avar Kriss, Bell Zettifar (✊🏾), or the protagonists Marchion Ro, Kassav Millikio, and others. We may see character on side A’s perspective and then flip to the other moments after—and the writing matches whoever is the subject perfectly. Chapters are pretty short, so it’s like watching a scene in a movie and waiting for the next transition between some parts.

I thought (before we learned what Project Luminous was last year) “what kind of conflict can they draw up that’s more appealing than Jedi vs. Sith or the Mandalorian Plot”? Turns out, the new antagonist(s) of this era is(are) very interesting and well-written, most notably Marchion Ro. 

The conflict that kicks off this whole era is WILD and it IMMEDIATELY drags you in, especially with how violent things are and how they have to be resolved. I would read some chapters before work because I was enticed. An element of Star Wars we might have taken for granted and as no big need for focus takes center stage.

I enjoyed most characters in the book, albeit a few that are there for that cheesy, Disney-brand comic relief. It did feel just SLIGHTLY campy at very few parts of the book—and (to me) it felt tropey having a lot of references to light in...The Light of The Jedi. Like, we get it. Lumens. Cool. There’s legit a dude named Captain Bright 😬

I’m also not a fan of some of the new “elements” of the series; for example: a “Longbeam” is a type of ship—and it just sounds eh to me, but it’s (again) my brain adjusting to new lore.

The book is worth a read—and the next part of the High Republic releases next month. Light of the Jedi is written for adults (there’s a chapter that goes into detail on space drug use 🥴, among other topics) and the next book, Into the Dark(har har Light and Dark, I get it🙄) that’s geared for young adults—so we’ll see about that one.",True,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1736600,public,spoiler,,,Spoiler Free Book Review - Star Wars {The High Republic} - The Light of the Jedi — 7.75 /10,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kvpipx/spoiler_free_book_review_star_wars_the_high/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Padme dies at the same time as Vader is ""born"" and during childbirth. The medical droids don't say she's dying because of a broken heart, they say she's dying, but otherwise healthy, and they can't explain it. She seems to have lost the will to live.

Here's the thing, of course they can't explain it. Sidious is killing her using the force. He's draining her life energy and feeding it into Vader. This is the technique he alludes to earlier in the film for staving off death and the reason you can't learn it from a Jedi is because it involves murder. 

Padme dies and Vader is born then Sidious tells him she's dead. How would he know if he hadn't been responsible? Why would he let her live anyway if he was to control Vader?

Like I said, this isn't a theory, it's a reading of the scene and how it plays out. The dialogue kind of confuses it a little (Lucas's biggest failing) but I'm certain that was the intended takeaway from how it's shit and everything we've seen in the film to that point.

All I ask for is civility.

I was introduced to star wars mostly through Clone Wars and the Sequel trilogy. As a kid I always heard about how amazing Luke was. That he was some kind of Space Superman who always does what's right and is a super powerful jedi. 

So to say I was told to expect Luke to be the coolest guy ever is an understatement. So when I did watch the original trilogy, he ended up totally falling flat for me as a character. He is just your generic fantasy hero I have seen a thousand times. Now you can say he is one of the first. He isnt, but let's just assume he was. That's great for the people in the 70s but he just doesnt do it for me. His character just feels so static. He doesnt change at all for 2 movies but then all of his character development happens of screen in return of the jedi. He goes from someone who can barely hold a lightsaber to a guy who can beat Vader in a one on one duel.

So when The Sequels started coming out I didnt care at all about the old characters. It was the new characters I was interested in. But when seeing The Last Jedi I was shocked by how much I like Luke in them.

He actually acts like a Human, who fought his father to the death, fought in a war for 5 years, who tried to rebuild a lost religion but failed and caused the deaths of his students due to his hubris. He is also really funny. He felt more like Luke then he ever did in Return of the Jedi. 

(Here is the part where I get personal)

I constantly live in fear of failing the people I care about. I'm terrified that I'm not a good person, that if I make a single mistake my life will be destroyed. So when I saw Luke. The ""Greatest Jedi ever"" dealing with that guilt, that self loathing. I finally managed to connect to Luke as a character. So when we finally see him realise his mistake for abandoning the resistance and makes his final stand to save what's left of the resistance. It really hit me emotionally. To me it showed that no matter how bad things get, that thier is always a chance to change things.

Now, when I Luke back at Luke in the OT I can see it as the building up of a broken man, who shares my same insecurities, and see him succeed in spite of them in the OT. So when I get to the ST, I can see him rise from his lowest point like a Phoenix.

As a consequence, I have been off work for a while and spending all hours of the night awake. During this time, I got a Disney+ subscription and opted to watch every single piece of Star Ware content on the platform (that I hadn’t either already seen or had but wanted a refresher). After such, I simply cannot accept the Sequel Trilogy as being canon. 

Why?

While every version of Star Wars media has its own STYLE - owing to different directors, live action versus animated, etc., the vast majority have kept a generally consistent MESSAGE and FORMAT. “Hope”, “A+B=C”, and almost every aspect of “the hero’s journey” story archetype. However, the Sequel Trilogy spits in the face of many of these “rules” and “themes”. Most notably, ROS, in which there is almost no coherent narrative, things seemingly happen for no reason or with no consequences, etc. The whole trilogy breaks down as a result of ROS and no longer functions as a three act tale.

What do I do with this opinion? Why should I care about your opinion?

Nothing. And, you don’t have to. I doubt I’m saying anything not already spoken to at length by other, more eloquent people. I simply wished to voice my thoughts (while admittedly in the middle of a half-awake diaper and bottle session). If you share similar feelings, I’m happy to discuss. If you disagree, I am happy to discuss. “Change my mind”, as the meme says. And, if this isn’t the right place for opinions, disregard me or downvote me. I’ll understand. All I ask is this: whether you agree with me or not, please be civil. I’m not calling you out for liking the Sequel Trilogy. I’m not even saying the Sequel Trilogy sucks.

He only learns that Luke is a force user at the end of A New Hope when Luke uses the force on his way to blow up the Death Star.

Even when he took action was a callback to Holiday Special when he wielded a gaffi stick the length compared to his pulse blaster. Even as a first time introduced to Din was how he was introduced to Luke. Unlike Luke, Boba allied with Din until he escaped into hyperspace.

His sleek look gives a call to when he first adopted his father's armor before customizing it to his own use. It does give off a lot of his grandfather's vibes wearing it since they had a red color scheme. Even his Clone Wars armor had a lot of influence in it.

His Journeyman Protector sigil even got some job done to when he was part of them.

The fanarts featuring him wearing a kama and the clones wearing a kama is an addition to what his robes represent since his father produced a lot of clone troopers during the clone wars.

TLDR: Episodes 7-9 were half-assed with a predictable and nonsensical plot. Disney took advantage of the nostalgic factor of fans and it felt like they didn’t take time to truly understand the Force and other concepts in the earlier movies.

This is a rant.

I’m 26 and I watched the first six movies of the Star Wars Saga when I was very young. I was chatting with my manager and offhandedly mentioned that I essentially “forgot” the Star Wars movies and had no interest in the newer ones/Mandalorian. After a few moments of shock, he challenged me to watch all 9 during my vacation. So I watched them in order from 1-9 in 9 days.

I absolutely abhor the newest movies (7, 8, and 9). Their tone feels completely different than the first six. It wasn’t nearly as heart-wrenching or exciting, all of the plot twists were VERY predictable, and what the hell is this Rey character who practically mastered the force in like 2 seconds??? Yoda had Luke *standing on his head* trying to make things float and this woman is suddenly stronger than someone with Skywalker blood because she believes in herself?!

I understand the whole ~girl power~ trope. I am a woman and it’s great to see a female lead but come on. Shoot, Kylo Ren should have beheaded her when he had the chance and then the trilogy could have been about his redemption - and I would have been okay with that. Since when could living people hologram themselves to have conversations with other living people?

In the earlier movies, the deaths of Jango and Boba Fett were sudden and quick. I was shocked and the battle scenes were so intricate I couldn’t even process it all. It showed me that even though they seemed important as characters, after they died you see that their death barely mattered - because the War was still going on and they had served their purpose. I don’t feel a connection with these newer characters. Why did that one woman sacrifice herself for Finn and say she loved him? There was no romantic tension with them before that!! Why?!?

Yoda established that fear of loss for people you're attached to can make you prone to weakness by the dark side, and that without ""calm"" and ""peace"" it and aggression flow very easily (and no, Luke rejecting the dark side in Return of the Jedi is not an automatic ""none of that stuff will ever bother me"" because A) That's not how people work, as proven by the fact that he rejected it by the end of The Empire Strikes Back as well and B) That had little to nothing to do with his arc, if anything his arc was the exact opposite of that)-in this case, Luke seeing a future in which Ben will not only turn into Kylo Ren (and yes, Yoda did tell him that the future is always in motion... and, huh... did Luke listen to that? I think not) and destroy everything Luke held dear in the process but also that Snoke ""ALREADY turned his heart"" despite Ben currently training under Luke to achieve the exact opposite (Leia in TFA: ""that's why I wanted him to train with Luke"" combined with how this is a regular part of Jedi training, especially of the kind Luke received) so yeah, Luke could and DID react this way for a moment before, heck last time he did he chopped off his father's hand instead of stopping as soon as he realized what he was actually doing, before snapping back to his senses... kinda like in another situation. Oh, and please don't respond with ""No it's just bad dream, not what Luke explicitly said happend"" (just one of those bad dreams that have never once turn Skywalkers to the dark side)

&amp;#x200B;

Luke, a person that was established to be as weak to attachment as he is throughout ALL of the OT (Owen and Beru, Han and Leia, the person he recently learned was his sister-each instigated a worse bit of impulse every time)-mentally collapsing upon having learned that he caused the deaths of his young students by failing his nephew (and by extension, his sister and best friend, and even his masters if you think about it) and causing him to turn evil and murder them, in a way that mirrored the mistakes of the Jedi before him (as he at some point learned... you know, that most of what he dedicated his life around has been a lie, in some sense) AFTER his victory with Vader? Absolutely believable, 100%. Just like with similar heroes such as King Arthur, Samurai Jack and Wolverine. There's good reason George Lucas had a similar idea for his own outline. I'm actually shocked that some people thought that a person so attached he doesn't even think to take Obi-Wan with him to his endangered home when he'd have nothing to lose in that case, so emotionally vulnerable that he immediately obliged the evil old guy you clearly should not be listening to telling him ""strike me down with all of your HATRED (after Obi-Wan and Yoda told him the exact opposite), and let your journey to the dark side be complete"" and so prone to darkness that that he force chocks and force crushes (top tier dark side ability, which keep in mind he used around the same time after he rejected Vader and his Emperor) for no practical reason, will be affected by depression and the dark parts of his nature the same way that... normal people do. Remind me, by the way, what was Yoda's reason to not help the rebellion and then, worst case scenario, train Luke as a force ghost? I forgot. Oh yeah-""Into exile, I must go. Failed, I have"" after at least 750 years of experience more than Luke had.

And before you read, if you know a lot about Star Wars was happen to know the time periods of what I’m about to discuss, TELL ME, cause I don’t wanna make a mistake.

So the film is about a group of storm troopers sent down to the forest moon of Endor to secure an area for a shield generator used for the 2nd Death Star.

The troopers are led by their captain, Rex, (sounds familiar? This is a little reference and to also add conflict to this character as he despises having the name of a Clone).

The film would take place around the same time as a new hope, with halfway through the film while trying to call out a transmission for help, a signal doesn’t go through as they find out the Death Star was destroyed, this brings out more of a side to storm troopers as they’ve just lost a major battle and are stranded as prey in a giant forest.

I won’t spoil any more than that, I don’t know exactly when the second Death Star began construction, but I think it could fit in? Because I don’t think there’s anything canon stating how the shield generator got on Endor? (Haven’t read the comics so not sure)

But what is the best lego game? Why of course, it is none other than how Modern lego started! Lego star wars, the complete saga. Also I suck at reviews so if it looks like I am simping for this game I probably am.

&amp;#x200B;

Lego star wars the complete saga is the 3rd modern lego game, but also techinically the 1st considering the 1st two lego games were combined in tcs, but anyway, everyone agrees it is really good, but never really go depth into WHY it is good (Except for schaffrillas productions he explains why really well), and In case you have never played it, here is my review because If You have played it I have good feelings that you liked it alot.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to agree with schaffrillas on the adaptation part, it is a PERFECT adaptation of star wars. Now I liked lego indiana jones 2, but it didnt adapt the crystal skull well, which is what tcs is for! It has lots of humor convayed purely through animation and GRUNTS. Also, the grunts in this game set off a great lego tradition that was slaughtered and replaced with inferior but still pretty good voice humor. Go watch schaffrillas and his review of lego star wars.

&amp;#x200B;

The co-op implementation in this game is great! If there is a character that only helps like a few times in a level, there is a 3rd character that can actually fight, and even if there is only 1 that can fight, the other character has many uses in the level! In short, the co-op requires connection between the two players, with one player fighting the boss and the other doing everything they can to help the fighter, you will NEVER be bored playing 2 player.

&amp;#x200B;

The death sounds can either be bad or amazing! Like the yoda one, his death sound is amazing and top tier, but for some reason, luke, han, and DARTH VADER have the same death sounds.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the bosses, man the bosses are great! The bosses are, well, bosses where you have to fight a sith lord while solving puzzles and challenges the boss throws at you just to get in a few more hits, with the two best levels being jedi destiny and darth vader. Again, watch the schaffrillas tcs reveiw for details on it, I do not want to copy his review for internet points.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, the characterization is top tier! You can make finn, you can make cad bane, heck, you can even make minor characters! The characters you make are up to you!

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, the difficulty progression in this game is done right! It starts off easy and soon becomes hard!

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, this game is not a flawless masterpiece, but by golly it sure is a masterpiece. 10/10",True,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1735431,public,spoiler,,,Why Lego star wars the complete saga is a masterpiece (Spoiler I guess?),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kvcdbi/why_lego_star_wars_the_complete_saga_is_a/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The force awakens showed how much potential this new trilogy had, and the last skywalker did a passable job on using that potential. But the last jedi SUCKED. Ok, I am over exagerating. The last jedi can sometimes be good, but it is outweighed by the bad. Lets start off with what I liked. Before we start I suck at reviewing everything so dont expect this review/rant to be good.

The movie can have some humor that nails, and the scenes on the island with luke can be genuinly nice at times, like chewie yelling at porgs that saw him eating a cooked porg, and R2-D2 getting mad at luke, and yoda is here! Yeah thats about it. Now for the meh.

&amp;#x200B;

The new characters arent really anything special, we just got another love interest for finn. Look, I want finn to have a girl, but isnt one love interest enough, we dont need two! Thats it for meh, nothing to mediocre, now for the stuff I dislike.

&amp;#x200B;

The last jedi is still filled with SO MUCH STUFF to try and lengthen the movie! Finn and rose go to the casino, they get captured, they escape the casino, they escape the planet. The movie at best feels like one long line of filler episodes, just like when they invade a empire ship. Thats it for the stuff I dislike. Now for the things I hate.

&amp;#x200B;

I do NOT like how leia just uses the force to get back to the ship. Seriously, it would have been loads better if leia died, not because I hate leia (I like her design), but because it wouldve made the story better! Rey hears about the gerenals death, and she decides to leave to get revenge on kylo ren, but before she does, luke tells her that he did the same thing and regreted it, and rey changes her mind and stays to complete her training! And to top it all off, there can be LOADS of nostalgia pandering, though it isnt a common problem, the times it does use nostalgia to keep people watching KILLS me. The ONLY, and I repeat, ONLY scenes I liked were with the droids, chewie, rey, and luke, thats all!

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I really dislike the movie. I know lots of people hate the last skywalker, but imo, this is the first and last bad star wars movie. If you want to watch the whole saga, then you can watch the last jedi, but if you already watched it I do NOT recommend watching it again. If I had to give it a review score, I would have to give it a 3/10, the only enjoyement I got from this movie were ironically the scenes where R2-D2 made noises at luke, and chewie growled at porgs.

I love the old republic era and the galactic republic during the clone wars/prequel era.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like the original trilogy era as much, because for me the best part of Star Wars is the universe, different characters, planets, politics, wars, overall schemes, but also small intriguing side stories. The original trilogy is more focused on a few selected characters, and the rest of the universe feels very shallow, I also don't connect as much to the characters.  (I grew up with the prequel era and obviously watched a lot of the original trilogy, and I DO like it, but I just don't like the whole setup of the era). I don't really like the sequel trilogy.

&amp;#x200B;

I have read Revan and Deceived and will probably read Fatal Alliance and Annihilation soon, but I was told they weren't as amazing as the two mentioned before.

I also read Dark Disciple and it was pretty good.

Other than that I didn't read any books, I obviously watched all the movies multiple times, I am really into TCW, don't like Rebels as a series but know about the major events and characters. I am not new to Star Wars and now a good amout of lore stuff aside from the movies and series, but I would like to expand in that.

&amp;#x200B;

The Thrawn trilogy (both legends and canon) seems to be very interesting, though the legend version seems be focused on the original trilogy set of characters which I am not as much interested in as I mentioned already, though Thrawn seems like an excellent character. The canon version seems less focused on those characters and more about Thrawn himself, but I have heard that it isn't as good as the legend trilogy.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bane trilogy sounds pretty good. The new High Era book seems interesting but I have heard and read mixed reviews about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Could the sequels have been better? Yes much, much better. But no movie can be perfect like my favorite movie has 10 things I'd change about it. Here's why I love it. Rise of Skywalker is also my favourite SW movie which I know is a very unpopular opinion but I'm proud to be different at least.

Firstly, it continues the famous story that ended decades ago with members of the cast returning. When Episode 7 came out I loved all the hype and find it sad how angry fans at 8 and 9 destroyed all that hype. But it's not surprising cause of how toxic the fanbase can be.

\-Like other SWs, it had John Williams, need I say more?

\-Visually amazing with less CGI and more practical effects.

\-Palpatine returning after thought to have been dead since 1983 for the grand finale felt awesome and him being the evil mastermind behind everything.

\-Palpatine's episode 9 form was so creepy, a resurrected Sith emperor attached to a giant machine like Frankenstein in a dark planet full of cultists.

\-The Jedi finally got back at Palpatine for all the shit he put them through by empowering Rey to defeat him, including cameos from Hayden Christensen, Liam Neeson, Ewan Mcgregor and Luminara my favourite Jedi. Would have been much better to show them as force ghosts but their voices was better than nothing.

\-Action scenes including Holdo's hyperspace ram, Luke pulling off the greatest mind trick to let the resistance escape and the epic ""there are more of us,"" scene in the climax of 9.

\-Lots of funny moments

\-More world building like Canto Bight showing more in the galaxy than just the war.

\-Twists like Snoke being killed off which was the only thing I didn't like about the Last Jedi but still seemed a cool twist as it was very unexpected and him turning out to be a creation of Palpatine who was alive were also twists.

But what I also understand is that the Sequel Trilogy was not released for no reason at all. And now that we're getting all of these new Disney+ shows (which I'm totally on board with), there is a lot of speculation that the new shows won't be connected to the new movies in a way that would make them matter the way they used to. They would be more or less seen as ""stuff happening over there, not really relevant"". Like, really? 

One of the reasons why I love the Sequel Trilogy is that it basically showed off the children of Skywalker, and they had new arcs of their own. It also took me a long time to understand why people hated Luke's new arc, and to a very small extent, I agree with why. At first, Luke was seen as a hopeful Jedi who saved his father from the very thing he had sworn to destroy a very long time ago. And now, around thirty years later, we learn that he had lived on a secluded island, with no connections with anyone on the outside, not even his own family. 

But just because I understand the fullest extent with why this is a problem to some people and I somewhat agree with why, doesn't mean I don't like it. To me, and me alone, it felt... new. I'm not really like other Star Wars fans who hold tons of expectations. I just sit down, and I see where it goes. And I suppose you can all color me as ""easily impressed"". The reason why I liked Luke's arc, is because it is poetic with how Anakin was imprisoned in Darth Vader for almost two decades up until he saw his family again. But then of course, he would die not too long after. That's exactly what happened with Luke in my eyes, and I can't help but appreciate that kind of thing. Not to mention that Luke's failure seeded a great character development for Ben Solo/Kylo Ren. It pushed him towards the Dark Side much how the Jedi who lived before pushed Anakin to the Dark Side because of their blindness to whatever truth was infront of them. To me, in regards to how Luke saw the previously existing Jedi Order as a complete failure. And given that he failed his own family, I'd understand that it would push him hard enough to isolate himself for decades. I know, I know, I know. Y'all hate it, so does Mark Hamil, so does Star Wars Theory, so does Geeks + Gamers, yada yada yada. But I unapologetically don't. 

And besides, the Sequels are a big part of Star Wars, because they are a part of the Skywalker Saga. So there is objectively *no reason not* to include them in the new Star Wars craze going on. These shows have the potential to fix a lot of plot holes and connect them to the Sequel Trilogy in all the right ways, and make them relevant again. I know the Sequels failed it's own characters. So what do you do with a mistake you make? Fix it, like how Luke fixed the chances of survival for the Resistance before he died.

However, they are now an important part of the Star Wars canon, representing an entire third of the main story of the Skywalker family, so now that they are finished and I've had plenty of time, I've let my brain go to work processing and analyzing what they mean in the context of the full 9 movies (I will mention the other works in the franchise, but this is mainly about the Skywalker Saga). 

  
I started this analysis by thinking of how I would do the Sequels better. I'm sure many people have imagined a way they could improve upon the last three films, frustrated by the resolution we were given, and I set first to dissecting what the point and character arcs of this trilogy were. At the heart of every trilogy of Star Wars films is the main point of it all, the main themes its trying to get across, and its place in the greater franchise. I had always seen the Prequel Trilogy as ""The Rise and Fall of Anakin Skywalker"", and the Original Trilogy as ""The Redemption of Anakin Skywalker"", with I through VI being a story about the Chosen One, the Jedi that would destroy the corrupt Jedi and the remnants of the Sith to bring balance to the Force, that balance being Luke. 

  
With an Anakin centric saga beforehand, what purpose did the Sequels serve, beyond extending the story longer? I wrestled with this for a long time before IX came out, and was even more bewildered when Anakin's sacrifice appeared to be for nothing, with Palpatine still surviving and the next generation being the ones to defeat him. Was Anakin's only role in this whole conflict to merely save Luke and Leia? It seemed like quite a stretch, and the fact that much of the trilogy was for money and fanservice weighed down on my mind when I started to take it seriously, but once again, I can't just ignore a third of the saga. 

  
To find a true theme, I would have to look beyond Anakin and my own personal biases, and explore what ties all three movies together. First, and foremost, Skywalkers. Each trilogy focuses on a generation of them, with overlap from the previous trilogy, and that was obvious enough. Luke, vital to Vader's redemption and training a disciple that would help redeem Kylo, was certainly an important player in two out of three trilogies, so I could forgive the lack of Sequel focus on Anakin. There was a second, and in my opinion, far more important theme, which was explored through the lens of the Skywalker family - the Force, and the Balance that sustains it. In the first two trilogies, we saw a flip-flop of the power in the Force from the Light (Jedi Order) to the Dark Side (Empire), and then from the Dark Side back to the Light (Luke, Leia, and the New Jedi Order). Similarly, the Sequel Trilogy was about the New Republic and New Jedi Order falling to the First Order, which could lend credence to the idea that the history of the galaxy is about each side having power then losing it... until the end of IX.

  
Episode IX, which could have featured a downer ending where the First Order/Final Order took power again over the galaxy, instead had the 'good guys' win, the Jedi triumph and live on while seemingly destroying the Sith. If one had watched only the Original Trilogy, this would seem like a happy ending, but on first view, something seemed off to me. I had gotten used to the idea that in the Prequel Trilogy, the Jedi having dominance led only to arrogance and blindness which let them be destroyed by a mere handful of Sith, plunging the galaxy into years of war. The lesson seemed at first that the Jedi and Sith, the Light Side and Dark, will destroy each other continuously, in a back and forth that will last until the end of time, and that IX was either a temporary destruction of the Sith, or a disruption of the previous cycle. The defeat of Palpatine might have meant the end of the cyclic conflict, but was that a good thing or a bad thing?

  
Now that I had a theme (worry not, I refined it later), my problem was with how the movies expressed it. As I got into it, however, I realized my issues were hardly with VIII or IX (blasphemy, I know). The real source of my anger with the current trilogy began to be directed towards VII, The Force Awakens, for setting the trilogy on its current track without properly introducing a character that proved so central to its story - Kylo Ren. VII, while interesting in theory, was crippled by its attempts to emulate IV by the book (something I attribute to Disney's paranoia of the Prequels - due to their initial critical backlash, any deviation from classic Star Wars was rejected, and they played it as safe as possible). The newest Skywalker was regulated to playing the role of Darth Vader, when he had so much more complexity below the surface. 

  
I laid down my mental pen and paper, and set out to create a new trilogy of my own, one which was largely just an edit of the pre-existing Sequel trilogy to better fit Kylo's character, and to better spell out the theme of the back-and-forth conflict, as well as the end of the Jedi-Sith war in Episode IX. I wanted to create a trilogy that, after two trilogies of showing a Jedi dominated galaxy and a Sith dominated galaxy, asked what balance meant, and if the galaxy could ever reach a balance. The most important part of this would be to get rid of Snoke (a useless middle-man), and to have Episode VII take place before Kylo's turn to the darkness. 

  
The new Episode VII, taking place on Coruscant, the capitol of the New Republic (it could be a different planet, but why fix what isn't broken?), would see Ben Solo nearing the end of his Jedi training, but facing difficulty that brought insecurity to the surface, an insecurity that he hid from his master, and that was fueled by a voice encouraging him to use his anger (which, later on would be revealed to be Palpatine, still alive as a vengeful spirit, a la Episode IX). The First Order would still exist, but instead of having a superweapon, they would instead have a strategy to invade Coruscant (insider information), and attack a demilitarized New Republic (which would justify Leia's quest to build a Resistance). The rest of the film would largely play out the same way, with Poe, Finn, and Rey trying to make their way across the galaxy to reveal that the First Order was planning to attack (instead of Luke Skywalker being missing). The end would focus on a invasion of Coruscant, coinciding with Ben burning down the Jedi Temple and becoming Kylo Ren, joining the invaders and fighting with Luke Skywalker. Luke would escape with the help of Rey, with Luke sensing something new in her. The Resistance would only narrowly escape the massive invasion force, as the First Order declared the return of the Empire. 

  
Episode VIII would play out largely the same, but instead of the Snoke plot, we'd see the newly minted Kylo Ren called to Exegol immediately (revealing his new master to be Palpatine), and being asked to bring Rey to Palpatine - showing directly how they became connected and able to see each other. Ben would be played much more sympathetically, having just turned to the Dark Side and being unsure of himself and what he has done, with Rey learning why he did it, and urging him that he can still be forgiven, while Kylo tries to trick her into coming to Exegol. The fleet chase plot would still be present, and Luke would be hiding out with Rey from the First Order, a bit shaken by the recent experience, and being unsure about whether to train her after seeing his failure. Instead of a few days, Episode VIII would take place over a longer period of time, showing the gradual fall of the New Republic, and would culminate in Rey going to Exegol, fighting Kylo, and barely escaping, now knowing who she is - Rey Palpatine. 

  
Unfortunately, that's as far as I got with my trilogy planning, unable to think of how to properly resolve the trilogy at that time, as something was still off to me. I still had a bad enough taste in my mouth that I was unable to think of how to answer the question of the balance of the Force. I don't truly think that the Jedi or the Sith are the answer to the galaxy, but what kind of ending would leave us knowing that there would be more war in the future, or that the galaxy was left out of balance?   
\---------------------------------------------  
One year later.

  
I had never seen The Clone Wars or Rebels when I watched the above movies, and I hardly thought I would find the answer in those shows, but just recently, I binged both and had an epiphany about the Force and the Balance between the two sides, one that answered my question. Spoilers follow.   
In The Clone Wars, we saw the Jedi and the Sith, sure, but the lines between the Light Side and the Dark Side became very blurred. The principles that the two Orders were supposed to follow were broken several times during the war - the Jedi became warmongers, paranoid of corruption when they were already lost, as best exemplified by some of their dubious missions. They nearly killed Ashoka, one of their own, as she begged them to look at the evidence, and then when they were proven wrong, claimed that it was the will of the Force that she had to be put through that trial. While advising Anakin to hide his feelings and control them, they put him through unimaginable levels of stress (faking Obi-Wan's death, threatening Ashoka, imprisoning Yoda, etc.) and then turned on him when he objected. 

  
On the Sith side, the Rule of Two was badly broken by the Clone Wars (even with the fact that assassins aren't Sith Lords), with Sidious training Count Dooku behind Maul's back and then allowing his former apprentice to live, just to further his own causes. Savage Oppress and Asajj Ventress were nearly apprentices of their own, before Sidious shot down Dooku's ambitions. His hypocrisy also spread to his plans - even though the Master could defend himself, Sidious intended fully to rule forever, to never be succeeded by another Sith, as he continuously planned to replace his Apprentice, to artificially live through cloning and dark magic, and to pervert the natural order. Sidious used the Sith Order only for his own goals, breaking rules and using them as he saw fit.   


These shows, however, called into question even the basic rules of both Orders. We were introduced to other species and peoples that used the Force outside of the Jedi and Sith, and both were powerful and in harmony with their respective aspect, without falling the binding laws that characterized the two halves of the Force - the Bardottans and the Dathomirians. The Bardottans used the Light Side of the Force - they were peaceful, kind, caring, and never used the Force for power, only for seeing the future and having advanced awareness. They were a passive society, and yet they very well allowed emotions and attachments. Only, unlike we see with the Jedi, these never led to their downfall. In fact, Queen Julia's love for Jar Jar Binks only led to a string of coincidences that saved her life and her people. Rather, it was the Jedi's repression of emotions that only made their passions stronger, as seen with Anakin, who allowed his anger to build up instead of expressing it in a healthy manner. 

  
On the other hand, the Dathomirians were powerful users of the Dark Side, with the Nightsisters unlocking magic and reality warping beyond anything we had seen in the franchise, and they were not unwilling to share it with each other. The Nightsisters did rule with fear and sought power, but it was power they had as a clan, a circle that trusted each other, and that formed a stable relation with the Nightbrothers, even if there was tension. They used the Dark Side without turning on each other or destroying themselves with greed, and even Sidious learned from their lessons. In the end, Maul, Savage, Ventress, and Talzin formed a threat that required Sidious's intervention multiple times, and aside from Savage and Ventress, they trusted and cared for each other. 

  
By the time of Rebels, we see Ashoka and Kanan represent Force-wielders who fight for the Light Side, but who aren't held back by the Jedi Code - they feel free to express their emotions and to have attachments to people, but instead of repressing their emotions, they simply don't let their emotions compromise their judgement - the true goal of a Jedi. No doubt Kanan would feel sorrow if he lost Hera, but the question is not 'should he have loved her?' but 'should he allow himself to be lost in sorrow when the team needs a leader?' 

  
Rebels also teaches one more important lesson - it plays up Luke's role as a Chosen One, with Maul deliberately saying it by name. Even though Anakin was a Chosen One, Rebels, with the prophecy of the ""Twin Suns"", establishes that Luke is also destined to ""Destroy the Sith"". This final piece of the puzzle brought me to the answer I had been looking for.  
\------------------------  
Today. 

  
At the end of the Sequel Trilogy, we see the Sith Order finally destroyed, with Palpatine and his followers crushed by the collapsing temple, and his goal of ultimate power over the universe finally gone, with no more clone bodies or Empire. However, in the process, the last two Jedi - Ben Solo and Rey, are killed. Any exceptions still alive are not part of the order - Ashoka left it and Ezra (if still alive) was trained by a Jedi but never made a Knight. Corrupt parties that held dominance over the Force and kept the galaxy at war are gone, but the Dark Side and Light Side live on. 

  
Rey, thanks to Ben's sacrifice, is revived, but she has still died, and so, symbolically, the Jedi died with her. That final explosion, when Palpatine died, was the final statement in the Skywalker Saga - the Jedi and Sith were destined to destroy each other. But Rey still lives, a Force user reborn - and what do we see her with in the finale? Not a blue, green, purple, or red lightsaber. She even buries the two relics of the Jedi of the past in the desert. No, she has a yellow lightsaber, an off-colored weapon that, to me, symbolizes the dawn of a new era. I think with her initial passing, she has awoken no longer a Jedi, but like Ashoka, a warrior of the Light Side. 

Just the same, the prophecy of the Chosen One seemed to fit Anakin, but it denies the inherent importance of Luke, as well as Ben. Anakin may have been the one to defeat Palpatine, but it was Luke, not through fighting, but through his words and bravery, that defeated Vader, and only through doing that was Palpatine able to be defeated the first time. And only through Luke's teaching would Rey be able to restore Ben to the Light Side of the Force, and only through both of their efforts would they be able to bring an end to the Sith Order. 

The Chosen One was never a single Skywalker - it was the bloodline. Every single Skywalker lent their hands to bringing balance to the Force - not by destroying the Sith, but by destroying the Sith and the Jedi, by returning the Force to a natural order. The bindings that the two Orders put on the Force left it in conflict, but the Light Side and Dark Side aren't weapons, they are inherent aspects of life. And so, Rey played her part in helping to defeat the Sith, but played an even more important role by being the one the Skywalkers chose to live on, to carry the memory of what had happened and to be the first in a generation of better Force users. Ben, Luke, and Leia chose to train her, to teach her the trappings of Jedi and Sith, and to give her their blessing. The Skywalker family died, having fulfilled its purpose to bring balance, and Rey keeps their name not just as an honorary member of the family, but as a promise of her role to keep the balance they created. 

If I had to rewrite the Sequel Trilogy now, I would make it like this: 

The films would involve three force wielders - Rey, the strongest of the new generation of Jedi, the undead/clone Palpatine, the representation of the Sith Order, and Kylo Ren, a Knight Templar who was dedicated to destroying both Orders, believing it was time for Jedi and Sith alike to end. He would go on a rampage to destroy the Jedi first, but in doing so, he would allow his inner balance to be conflicted while fighting Rey, and allow himself to fall under the spell of Palpatine. Rey, believing in the inherent good within Kylo, would fight Palpatine, and Kylo would realize his mistake and how far he had fallen, helping to destroy the last of the Sith. Rey would perish in battle, unintentionally fulfilling Kylo's quest, but instead of wanting the two Orders to end, Kylo would understand that the Light and Dark side would always exist, and that they don't need to be destroyed. At the beginning of the trilogy, Kylo would think of the Jedi and Sith as being fundamentally tied to the Dark and the Light, but the question of whether balance could exist would be proven to him by Rey and Palpatine.

With the return of Jango Fett (which was fantastically built into the show IMO), there is a brief scene of tension with Bo-Katan Kryze and Fett in which she challenges, but even more so is disgusted with, Fett donning his fathers armor.

My question: From what I could tell Jango was a full Mandalorian born on Concord Dawn. Now due to their well above average physique, combative nature, and general superhuman athleticism, strength, etc., I’m guessing he was chosen as the template for all original clones based off of this alone? 

Therefore, Bo-Katan’s criticism of Boba is based off the fact that he is actually a clone, not necessarily a Mandalorian but a “gross” copy of one. However, it seems that the Kryze clan has a different idea of what it means to be Mandalorian, with a much less critical view of someone like Din who was a member of The Watch. 

Yet Din seems to carry no problem with Boba donning the armor following his proving of it being a family possession (his fathers). I suppose my question: Does Bo-Katan’s main hatred for Fett stem originally then from her hatred of the empire and clones in general, and does this meld into her idea that Clones were simply a gross tampering with Mandalorian biology? Fett was obviously both a foundling and recipient of full Mandalorian training just as Din was, so what about Fett does Kryze find so repulsive? 

Also, how in the hell did Boba Fett survive his run-in with the Sarlacc? Obviously a very badass and capable warrior proven in S2, but how is that possible? I guess the answer is more speculation than anything.

Jar jar to me wasn't too annoying and I actually chuckled at a few of his lines, there were a few low brow jokes where i rolled my eyes pretty hard but they were few and far between.

There was more action than I remember too, I was pretty engaged all throughout. My only complaint is the CGI, it is particularly bad in the movie, especially the battle on Naboo.

Despite all the cringe, un-starwars jokes and Rose, I can't help but smile whenever any of the original trilogy cast are on screen. 

The force awakens is a great film, and the opening is probably the most brutal introduction to a star wars film we have had, and its from Disney. Massacring an entire village is a nice way to set the tone. Everything with Han, Chewie and Leia was almost flawless. Yeah, its a safe movie but its enjoyable to watch. It was basically A New Hope with the even bigger death star, but think about it. The death star was the most powerful weapon in the galaxy. So why wouldn't you try and replicate it or make it better ? Why would you waste your time on a weapon that is different than the death star, when that is literally the ultimate weapon. Once Count dooku got those early death star plans in Geonosis, the ultimate weapon meta was changed forever.

Now the Last Jedi...As soon as luke threw the lightsaber off the cliff you knew something was not right. But in my opinion the entire first half of the movie could have been considered flawless if it wasnt for the second half of the film. The movie sucks because of the second half. Because half the time we are in a casino freeing CGI animals. Once Luke spoke to yoda, which was the best scene in the movie (or even trilogy?) he shoulda gotten off his ass and got straight in that X-wing and join the resistance. If that entire second half of the movie was replaced with Luke coming to his senses, joining the resistance and leading from the front with all of his sick jedi force powers, that would have made for quite a finish. We could have seen a fully enraged Kylo ren battle a re-enlightened Luke skywalker, and it would have made for quite a battle. The movie would have been perfect. But now its always going to be tainted as the worst star wars movie ever made, and it had so much fucking potential! And honestly, Finn shoulda died. It would have been a powerful moment. Why does the main cast always have to survive. Its too predictable. God damn it Rose...

And finally the Rise of skywalker. Well shit. It was aight. But god damn, palpatine coming back was fucking stupid. Like come on. Snoke was actually kinda sick. He was sadistic in his own way. And we could have had Luke and Rey vs Kylo and Snoke which would have been sick. Masters Vs Apprentices. But I just don't like how everything leading up to the sequels will now somehow be linked to palpatines reincarnation. And his death was even more stupid. Like when the fuck is he going to learn that the answer to blocked force lightening isnt more force lightning. I mean, shes walking slowly towards you...just idk move to the left or something. Or just don't stand still? And I can't help but say "" I am iron man"" whenever I see that scene. It was a pretty shitty ending in my opinon. But its not all bad. The scene where Chewie screams after Leia's death is emotional as hell. And seeing Lando and chewie embrace was good too. And luke finally levitating the Xwing to yoda's theme was great as well. And Han's brief return to save Kylo was a nice touch. But the movie could have been so much better and memorable if The Last Jedi didn't flop.

Overall, somethings in the sequels were flawless, and others outright sucked. Kylo Ren in my opinion was the leading character in the sequels and I do hope we get more of him prior to TFA, going out and doing shit with the knights of ren who were criminally underused in the series. But apart from that, honestly, there was nothing that really stood out to me in the trilogy as a whole. They are enjoyable movies to have in the background to watch some spectacular visuals, but they could have been so much more.

The book was due to release in 2016 but was ""delayed indefinitely"". According to interviews with Rinzler, Disney refused to release it sighting PR problems, that it showed that it was a difficult, if not messy production at times (like most films of that scale, as he pointed out).

He also mentioned that in contrast, George Lucas was very open about his productions, that he thought sharing the difficulties of day to day production was a natural part of filmmaking. Disney had a more corporate perspective, relegating the behind the scenes stuff to the PR department.

I can believe in palpatine coming back, the force dyad teleportation stuff maybe, too. I loved the flights scenes and the cinematic design. Tho i don't believe they named the starkiller base after the character instead just of killing stars, destroying stars were already sold out. 

Did anyone of you expect the story of rebels getting the deathstar plans that amazing as Rogue One did? 
I didn't and my favorite character of RO is Krennic. 

There could also be amazing short adventures between the sequel timeline which are amazing. 
Maybe just a planet trying to get rid of the first order. 

Tldr: i believe we will look back at the sequel timeline one day and maybe think its alright.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1734412,public,self,,,In a time far far away from now,0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kv1nc7/in_a_time_far_far_away_from_now/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Particularly, what does it mean for Anakin to be a messianic ""Chosen One"". 

Questions like:

* Is Anakin just a mere mortal who was gifted with this great power?
* Is Anakin essentially being used as a tool by the ""Will of the Force"" (if that's a thing)?
* Is Anakin himself ""The Will of the Force"" incarnated in to the physical world as a mortal being?

 I find the idea of Anakin being an Incarnation of the Force kind of fits. Since the Force seems to metaphysically be some opposing duality of light vs dark that needs balance, this would account for the fact that Anakin is the ""Chosen One"" yet turns fully evil and in to the villain (and of course finally to be redeemed through his son and final sacrifice). The Force does not seem to be an ultimate ethical authority and therefore one would not expect the Incarnation (Anakin) to take the form of some perfect, faultless being.

I would expect the Incarnation of the Force to play out as a story that encompasses the entire spectrum of dark and light and finally comes to a harmony. And as we know, that is Anakin's story -- He goes through the world's worst things imaginable -- born in to slavery, murdered mother, war, mutilation, fear, loss, etc.  He is also faces the greatest temptations -- gifted with unrivaled power and potential ,tempted with ultimate glory, power, greed, love, etc. He commits the most selfish acts imaginable (thoughtlessly destroying an entire planet to pursue his own power) and also commits the most selfless act imaginable through his final sacrifice thus turning his entire story to one of redemption.

Anyhow, would like to hear other people's ideas on how you understand the idea of Anakin as ""The Chosen One"" and what that really means. I also am not too familiar with Star Wars outside the feature films so if there are other sources that develop these kinds of ideas I would love to hear about that as well.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1734405,public,self,,,Metaphysics and Anakin as the Incarnation of the Force,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kv1k85/metaphysics_and_anakin_as_the_incarnation_of_the/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We’ve seen that Sheev sent his “sith assassin” Ochi from TROS after Vader. This all but confirms they’re trying to flesh out the events before that film. Vader also finds the weird Mustafar creature that Kylo talks to in the deleted scenes...

My theory is that Vader will find Exegol and Palpatines lab... and for some sweet revenge after everything Palps has put him through during this ark... he destroys the “fully functioning” lab and body Palps had in the event of his death.... all that’s left are the scraps we see in TROS. This will make it so that Vader is still hugely responsible for Palpatines ultimate end. Sheev is left with a hastily put together body leaving him incredibly weak and vulnerable for Rey and Ben to kill..... this would also remove the plot hole of Vader not telling Luke that Palpatine may have survived, because he doesn’t actually know....

Although I have mixed feelings about Palps return in the new films..... it is what it is and there’s no changing it.... what I do feel can happen is that they flesh out the events before the sequel trilogy with a “clone wars esque” show about the OT trio, Ben Solo, Reys parents and their connection to Palpatine, some juicy Snoke backstory, and maybe Ahsoka meeting Luke and Leia.....

I'd appreciate avoiding comments to the effect of ""I'd be none of these, I'd rather be 'insert faction here'"", as these are neither relevant nor productive to the dialogue. Gray Jedi, being independent from the actual Order, are similarly irrelevant)**

&amp;#x200B;

**First, here are the three primary, most well known Jedi classes within the Order (alphabetically):**

&amp;#x200B;

[**Consular-**](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Consular) I, like all Jedi, am proficient with the blade but prefer igniting it strictly as a last resort. I am more prone to try diplomacy first, seeking harmony &amp; peaceful conflict resolution via words or the Force such as the Jedi Mind Trick. My approach to any situation is calm and collected. My activities rarely cross onto the battlefield, as my time is most often devoted to studying the mysteries of the Force and letting its will guide me in my pursuits or missions. I am generally more likely to take on the role of an instructor than a combatant, mentoring the next generation of Jedi. While I traditionally wield a green lightsaber, there is no rule preventing me from customizing my weapon, however best suits me. Historically, when a Consular attained the rank of Jedi Master, we were once given the honorific title of ""Sage Master"".

&amp;#x200B;

*Examples*\- Ki-Adi-Mundi, Kreia, Luminara Unduli, Nomi Sunrider, Qui-Gon Jinn, Satele Shan, Yoda

&amp;#x200B;

[**Guardian-**](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Guardian) My skill and talent lay more in battle, in a sense being the equivalent to a Sith Warrior. I prioritize martial training and typically engage in combat more often than other Jedi, but this does not take away from my skills in diplomacy. Like all Jedi, I am first &amp; foremost a keeper of the peace. Though no stranger to warfare, I am not a soldier. While I traditionally wield a blue lightsaber, there is no rule preventing me from customizing my weapon, however best suits me. Historically, when a Guardian attained the rank of Jedi Master, we were once given the honorific title of ""Warrior Master"".

&amp;#x200B;

*Examples*\- Anakin Skywalker, Kit Fisto, Luke Skywalker, Mace Windu, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Shaak Ti

&amp;#x200B;

[**Sentinel-**](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Sentinel) Seeking a balance between the two extremes of the Guardian and Consular, I am usually seen as your more well-rounded Jedi. I am more open to expanding my variety of skills to a wider range and always welcome an opportunity to learn something new, including non-Force related topics. Although I do not commit myself as fully to any one area of skill like the Guardian's blade-work or the Consular's devotion to the Force, I also do not share either's weaknesses. My combat ability is sufficient and my knowledge of the Force fairly extensive, but my greatest strength is my versatility.

&amp;#x200B;

I may study any number of fields (security, computers, mechanics, medicine, etc) that could aid me in future endeavors. Because of this, many Jedi are likely to join my line of work. However, even compared to other Jedi paths, mine is perhaps one of the most difficult and consistently risky. My duties mainly involve investigation &amp; spying, gathering intel on injustice throughout the galaxy via stealth &amp; subterfuge before exposing and confronting it. This often keeps me off-world, sometimes for long periods, which raises my chances of encountering and/or being tempted by the Dark Side. We practice mental conditioning to prepare for this as well as commonly training to use two lightsabers. If I've done my job right, you'll never know I was there. While I traditionally wield a yellow lightsaber, there is no rule preventing me from customizing my weapon, however best suits me.

&amp;#x200B;

*Examples*\- Atton Rand, Bastila Shan, Jaden Korr, Kam Solusar, Mira, Quinlan Vos, Visas Marr

&amp;#x200B;

**Next are the branching specializations within the Jedi's three main classes (alphabetically):**

&amp;#x200B;

[**Artisan-**](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_artisan) Specialization of the Sentinel. I endeavor to understand creativity as a core element of the Force's will, having long held a fascination and intrinsic talent with tools &amp; machines. I apply my knowledge of and connection to the Force in artistic pursuits (constructing lightsabers &amp; holocrons, sculpting, etc) with the goal of bringing genuinely unique creations into being.

&amp;#x200B;

*Examples*\- Duros Felanil Baaks, Jwartek, Vodo-Siosk Baas

&amp;#x200B;

[**Healer-**](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_healer) Specialization of the Consular. Expanding on the basics of healing taught to all Jedi at the Temple, my pursuits center around medicine and studying ways in which the Force can be used to heal rather than simply hurt or manipulate others. Some of us seek a career in the Medical Corp. However, it would be unwise for any enemies of the Jedi to believe I cannot defend myself when necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

*Examples*\- Barriss Offee, Cilghal, Vokara Che

&amp;#x200B;

[**Investigator-**](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_investigator) Specialization of the Sentinel. I work closely with law enforcement to catch criminals and solve difficult or mysterious cases (basically the Jedi's equivalent of a detective). While I am more than capable of dealing in Dark Side-related threats when necessary, crime is my usual territory. Deduction, tracking and blending in are my forte, and I may go undercover for long periods to crack a case.

&amp;#x200B;

*Examples*\- Keelyvine Reus

&amp;#x200B;

[**Jedi Temple Guard-**](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Temple_Guard) Specialization of the Sentinel. I serve as the temple's security force, reporting to its head security detail and keeping a watchful eye over this sacred ground. I am anonymous, concealing my face behind the formal mask &amp; robes, as my identity is not important. There is no emotion, nor attachment in this higher purpose. My body is merely an extension of the Jedi Order, sworn to defend its honor and all those within its halls. With my double yellow-bladed lightsaber pike, those who would intrude upon the temple or threaten the Jedi had best be prepared to face me first.

&amp;#x200B;

*Examples*\- *Star Wars Rebels* Season 2 Episode 18: *""Shroud of Darkness""*

&amp;#x200B;

[**Lore Keeper-**](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lore_Keeper) Specialization of the Consular. This broader responsibility can be attributed to almost any Jedi Knight or Master who devotes their time to the pursuit of greater knowledge and critical thinking. My day-to-day activities may not always be as exciting or popular as other Jedi's, but are nonetheless one of the most important. We are the keepers of a vast and sacred history, responsible for collecting, translating, copying, arranging, and protecting the ever expanding knowledge passed down by all generations of Jedi going back millennia. Sometimes also called *""Jedi Scribes""*, we have the privilege of serving among what are effectively guardians of the Jedi's past, present and future. While often remaining close to the Temple's library, there are those of us who choose to get out there and explore the galaxy for new knowledge to contribute. Any information we learn from others or through firsthand experience, however seemingly insignificant, can potentially be of value one day. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's not uncommon to find us habitually recording our discoveries in our personal journals or the archives directly. With enough time, education and perseverance, you can help in this time-honored tradition. Join the Archivists who organize the many texts that help to cultivate new Padawans and are often looked to by Masters seeking wisdom from our predecessors. Perhaps you'd prefer the Historians or *""Chroniclers""*, who research not only the Jedi but also the storied histories of the Republic, overseeing the analysis of our holocrons protected by the Caretaker of First Knowledge (leader to the Council of First Knowledge). Become a Librarian or someday even Chief Librarian, presiding over the Temple Archives on Coruscant and their satellite facilities. Make no mistake though, being scholarly focused does not mean we neglect the other aspects of our training like the lightsaber.

&amp;#x200B;

*Examples*\- Jocasta Nu

&amp;#x200B;

[**Peacekeeper-**](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Peacekeeper) Specialization of the Guardian. One of the oldest and most prevalent roles within the Jedi Order's long history, my area of study is aimed toward law enforcement and security operations. I commonly collaborate directly with local authorities, during which my efforts may likely cross paths with those of a Jedi Investigator (such as cooperating on a case). Unlike the Investigators who typically react to criminal activity and violence, however, my job is to ideally suppress or prevent it from erupting in the first place. On Coruscant, we are based out of the Jedi Temple, many of us working under the Temple Security Force. Charged with safeguarding its denizens and valuables, we keep a watchful eye over all those who call the Temple Precinct their home on a day-to-day basis. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Examples*\- Jurokk, Tera Sinube

&amp;#x200B;

[**Recruiter-**](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_recruiter) Specialization of Jedi Knights that desired to become Sentinels. I have what has been considered throughout the history of the Jedi Order to be one of its most unpopular roles, bearing the brunt of anti-Jedi sentiment from citizens of the Galactic Republic. Mine is a particular field of study often occupied by retired Jedi Investigators, using my tracking and detection-based Force abilities to seek out potential Force-sensitives. Individuals with this gift may not yet sense it themselves, and my duty involves explaining it to them in hopes that they will choose to learn the ways of the Jedi.

&amp;#x200B;

*Examples*\- Torr Snapit

&amp;#x200B;

[**Researcher-**](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Researcher) Specialization of the Consular. Differing from the Lore Keepers' more academically focused work, I have a wider range of scientific studies to choose from which are sometimes more dangerous but equally important to the growth of the Jedi's knowledge &amp; understanding of the galaxy at large. Granted, not all of us are actual ranking members of the Order in spite of them running the Educational Corps, as there are those who received the necessary training to be recognized as Jedi but failed to pass their Initiate Trials are were thus rejected from progressing further at the academy.

&amp;#x200B;

 Fortunately, the Educational Corps is made up of everything from scholars to Archivists, Teachers, and more so you won't want for opportunities to find a job that best fits your talents &amp; passions. We're always looking for highly qualified Jedi whose fields of expertise can contribute to research in science, from biology to astronomy, philosophy, geology and scientific theory. If you favor being out in the field over working as a scholar, however, there is no shortage of pursuits in archaeology to explore ruins from past generations of Jedi among other cultures' secrets. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Examples*\- Sabla-Mandibu 

&amp;#x200B;

[**Seer-**](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Seer) Specialization of the Consular. I act as a conduit to the Unifying Force which surrounds, penetrates, and connects all the shining stars as well as lifeforms who live between them throughout the universe. Chosen as one of a select few Jedi with significantly higher susceptibility to receive the most vivid of Force visions, mine is one of the Order's most ancient duties: To decipher, interpret, and report findings from these dreams to the Jedi Council &amp; Council of First Knowledge respectively. We are the first line of defense to warn of impending threats such as those from the Dark Side. As Grand Master Yoda says though, *""Always in motion is the future. And many possible futures, there are.""* Having a regular collaboration with the Order's Lore Keepers, we contribute continually updated information to be recorded &amp; stored inside the Jedi's holocrons. On rare occasions in which one of us glimpses into the far future and a new prophecy is discovered, he/she may also earn the nickname of *""Jedi Prophet""*. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Examples*\- The Jedi Council of Seers

&amp;#x200B;

[**Shadow-**](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Shadow) Specialization of the Consular and Sentinel. Having narrowed the focus of my training to specific skills beneficial in my role, I am hand-picked from among the Jedi's most elite (mostly Sentinels), working closely with and reporting directly to the Council of First Knowledge. Though highly respected, I am by no means a popular presence at the Temple or its precinct. True to my title, I am a shadow working in darkness &amp; secrecy to serve the Light, appearing only when I wish to be seen and vanishing just as quickly. In times of great conflict, I may be deployed to assist my Jedi comrades but will not usually participate in open battle. Tasked to seek out, identify and destroy any/all sources of the Dark Side down to the tiniest traces as well as those adept in its practices such as the Sith, my pursuit of information gathering goes well beyond that of a mere Jedi Investigator. 

&amp;#x200B;

For, I leave no stone unturned no matter how remote and will not stop until I have all data necessary to find my target and make a decisive move, only relenting when ordered to do so or reassigned. Be warned though, this job is not for the faint. The single-minded determination required in a Shadow's ongoing hunt for the Dark Side can risk giving way to paranoia, leading those of us who become too immersed in this chase to start seeing signs of darkness even when it isn't truthfully there (even within fellow Jedi). I may even betray one that I consider evil, depending on evidence and circumstance. To avoid this fate, tact and restraint are demanded to keep us from falling victim to our own resolve. Moreover, my definition of what constitutes a threat may not always coincide with the Council's criteria to justify taking such action, especially given our often more aggressive methods to get results. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Examples*\- Maw, Taria Damsin

&amp;#x200B;

[**Watchman-**](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Watchman/Legends) Specialization of the Sentinel. I specialize in the pursuit and elimination of any/all injustice throughout the galaxy. Unlike many Jedi who mentor one or more Padawans and thus work as a pair, or Jedi that fought together in groups during larger-scale battles like those of the Clone Wars, I generally work alone in my service to the Light Side. Typically assigned to a single planet or system (sometimes for years at a time, making visits to the Jedi Temple few and far between), my role is keeping the peace, protecting the rights &amp; welfare of innocents from those who would threaten them, bettering society however I can such as by collaborating with existing governments, and tracking sources of evil like Dark Side users to confront &amp; eliminate them when needed. Reporting my work regularly, I act as a crucial liaison between the Jedi Council and planetary authorities.

&amp;#x200B;

*Examples*\- Kai Justiss, Meetra Surik, Tarr Seirr

&amp;#x200B;

[**Weapon Master-**](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Weapon_Master) Specialization of the Guardian. Standing among the Jedi Order's greatest warriors, I am not satisfied with mastery over the lightsaber alone. Believing that the most versatile fighter is very often the most effective, I've committed myself to studies in a wider range of physical combat arts enhanced with the Force, earning much respect from both the Jedi Council and my comrades outside the Jedi Temple. Though still prioritizing this work ethic to the mastery of a specific specialization, I am proficient in a variety of martial arts &amp; weapons from the standard to the exotic or even unorthodox. With this expanded knowledge and experience, I instruct other Jedi (most often Guardians in training) in hopes of honing their existing skills while also broadening their capabilities.  

&amp;#x200B;

Bad Batch: I think we very well may see the cut Cad Bane and Boba story from clone wars be made here.

Obi wan Kenobi: I believe we will see Cal Kestis and the Mantis crew in this series.

Andor: I think Saw Garera, Hera, Kanan and Zeb might appear in this show.

Mandalorian: I believe Ochi and Reys Parents might appear in Mando eventually.

Rangers of the New Republic: I Hope we see Rex and Admiral Holdo in this series with the Knights of Ren or a precursor being a main antagonist. Maybe leia and han too if they are willing to go that far.

Ahsoka: I am almost certain that we will see Luke and his academy here along with Young Ben, Ezra and Sabine.

Book of Boba Fett: I believe we will see the beginning of the Gang wars between Kanjiklub and the Guavian Death Gang begin here along with young versions of Zorri Bliss and DJ

Lando: I believe the series is a post Rise series with flashbacks to Solo era lando. So I believe Rey, Finn, Poe, Jannah, Qi ra and Maul will appear in the show.

I struggled first two seasons, shared my feelings with reddit and everybody saying it gets better later, so I followed some advices and referred to guides listing must-watch episodes to get through faster skipping parts, but even to S7 it all roughly felt the same to me all along.

  
First of all, I had a hard time with the facial art, it felt SO off compared to the overall tone of the realistic/movies-like esthetic. I just didn't connect with the characters partly because of that. This a big reason I won't watch Rebels, the art style seems even more into its cartoonish 3D that i can't digest.

If the intention is to connect with younger audience, i can understand but make it all-in with the art style (maybe like Forces of Destiny from what I've seen)

  
Secondly, I was disappointed in some of the characters. Mainly Anakin, I was hoping for more nuance but he's mainly characterized like the average good guy hero, typical Greace-god looking, voice actor did ok job but too generic ""manly"" voice and I think Hayden in the movies was less typical and more unique. As a character, he didn't really felt conflicted, he is genuinely pictured as a good person that can handle the bad stuff.  
Neither Grievous nor Dooku added much more depth from that they get in the movies. New characters like Ventress or SAVAGE OPRESS&gt;!(how can you take a guy named like that seriously, i know there are silly names in SW but this one... it's like sand..)!&lt;didn't bring anything new or interesting towards the CW plot or in general.  
And my biggest disappointed being ..Maul. He was one of my favorite vilain when i was little and it's like he's a completely new character in this show. In the 1999 movie, he was a beast of pure rage catalyzed in skill and fear, and his lack of dialogue, background and even screen time made him that mysterious, fascinating and emblematic character. The fact he survived his incredibly fatal wound, because of the intense revenge provided by the dark side got me intrigued and i could bear with the idea, and his introduction showing him completely mad in his cave was on the right track (i didn't get why the spider-like look tho, i mean the multiple legs is very cool looking but 4 legs would have been enough, adding even the abdomen to make him literally look like a spider was overkill, but anyway). But after he was removed his illness by ??*magic*?? (even his ROBOTIZED new legs was implemented by *magic)*, he just became a brand-new character. And it would have been way more interesting, in my opinion, seing him reconstruct himself bit by bit, through training provided by his brother, or the sisters. I think it would have been so much better to keep Maul the rage-muted beast that Savage is portrayed in the show, and make actual Savage the mastermind/war strategist Maul has become. So Maul would have kept his only still-living-reason revenge for Obi-Wan as an tool to introduce his brother for the Mandalore plot, wanting to redeem his brother from the injustice he was victim of.  
Night Sisters arc is also a waste of potential, discovering a civilization ruled by women empowering men is very interesting, but never fully explored.  
On a positive note, Obi-wan still remains a real CHAD and Ashoka kicks ass.

Finally, and this is why I skipped a lot of episode, there are just too many useless fillers. I've seen people saying ""there is no filler, don't watch it to skip parts, everything helps built characterization, it's the whole point"". I agree, but I feel it kinda fails to properly expend on why this war actually happens in the end, even the main clone wars plot ; I thought clones obeyed order 66 because.. they are literally GOOD SOLDIERS that follows orders from the highest hierarchy, not because there were implanted some kind of ex-machina chip into their brain. I get it was to humanize them and find an excuse to them obeying mercilessly to this order, but it really felt kinda cheap to me (no puns intended). I now it is a symbol materializing soldiers-brainwashing, but it takes too much time explaining what/where/how it is, to make it work to the degree indented.  
Some episodes felt even really out of place in the lore, especially the dark side brother/light side sister episodes. I hate when the force is too literally represented like some kind of magic sorcerers. And it don't even have consequences, like making Anakin sees his future just to make it forget everything.. what was the point ? What did he get out from it ?  


So anyways, a big let down the show was for me. I know I skipped some parts but couldn't handle more. Good story elements but the delivery of presentation, plots and characterization is either lacking or overkill and didn't add as much depth or fun as I hoped it would after seeing that much praises in the community (you know, expectation..)

Feel free to provide some suggestions on my writing. I can edit them later so that it will be easier to read in the future. I'm fine with what Disney did with Luke in the sequels. I understand most of Star Wars fans didn't like how Luke was portrayed in the sequels, and how he was massacred by them. But I got to give Mark Hamill a ton of credit for stepping out of his comfort zone to become some old, bitter and depressed Jedi veteran in the sequels. However, I think the execution of Luke not being someone what we really expected isn't as convincing as it should be. 

The biggest problem for me in the sequels is not Luke, it's Rey. Despite being a obvious Mary Sue throughout the sequels, like being excellent in flying without having any training and experience and etc, I think she should not even being a granddaughter of Palpatine, the most evil person in the whole galaxy. There are numerous evidence that suggests how Rey are linked to Palpatine way before the release of TROS, in terms of the fighting style, the accent, the music, and the aggression. 

As interesting as it seems, Disney seems to have a clear lack of direction about her lineage. At some point they wanted to make her as a daughter of Obi-Wan as well. **Why not just stick the decision to make her as a nobody in TLJ?** If Palpatine can manipulate Ben Solo to join the dark side, why shouldn't he do the same to Rey as well? Palpatine can manipulate her thinking she is the direct descendent of evil? Palpatine can also manipulate Luke and Leia thinking that she is a Palpatine so they wouldn't train her.

Season 1 + 2!!!

-

Okay, first off, I really enjoyed the Mandalorian. I thought it was a ton of fun. I need to make that absolutely clear. However, there were many times that I felt there was too much Disney leaking in.

Now, surprisingly, I didn’t feel like the Child himself created any real issues. I expected him to be a bit cartoony and weird, but that didn’t really happen. I understand that in a broader sense, he was a marketing ploy, but he felt very natural in the StarWars universe!

That being said, there were a few episodes and moments throughout the show that I can’t get out of my mind.

Take Chapter 4. “The Sanctuary.”

That episode seriously felt like something out of a Disney cartoon. The village, for instance. I understand that the StarWars galaxy is meant to be broad and diverse - not everyone is a space warrior with a starfighter. But this just felt wrong. Nothing about it felt like it belonged in that universe. And you could tell that they knew it. They forced in that farming droid, just so they could say it’s StarWars, in the same way that Porsche had to throw an Astromech in their StarWars ship. The biggest offender of this episode - and it was only for a moment - was when the village children were looking at Grogu and giggling, as well as when the little girl asked Mando if she could play with him.

In Season 2, the whole thing with the Frogs was also overdone. I know that people had issues with the eating of the eggs - I don’t want to get into that. But the reuniting of the two frogs and all that? You can’t not see what I’m talking about here.

There were also bits of dialogue scattered throughout both seasons that felt very Disney. Think about the mechanic in the hangar on Tatooine. I thought she was an incredibly fun character, but when she was telling Mando he was a bad parent, as well as when she was speaking “Frog?” It just didn’t feel like StarWars.

They tried to do another one of these cute moments when Grogu and R2 were interacting. Moments in the Sequel Trilogy with R2 (and 3PO) were typically heartfelt and just seemed organic and real. The scene in Mando? It just felt like they wanted the cute droid and the cute baby Yoda in one scene.

I think the issue I have with all this is that the show was so inconsistent in this way. Certain moments, such as with Boba Fett and Mando’s interactions, felt really like StarWars, and Chapter 1 seriously blew me away with how StarWars it really felt. But so much of the show felt like Disney was trying to pander to the child audience. 

I was incredibly hyped for this show, and truly loved it, and am dying for more. But now, I’m truly worried for the future of StarWars on Disney+. I’m worried that the Book of Boba Fett will not feature the brutal, merciless bounty hunter we loved for decades. I worry that Andor will lose the Original Trilogy feel that Rogue One had. I fear that Kenobi will sweep all of the Darkness of Vader and the Purge/Order 66 and rise of the empire under the rug. I’m also worried about the Marvel shows. I was so hyped for all of them. Now, I’m worried that the twisted, dark contrast of the Sitcoms and a dark reality in Wandavision will just be goofy spoofs with, well, different sitcoms. I’m worried Loki will just be lazy fan-service.

Are my fears irrational? Did anyone else feel this way?

My boyfriend is a long time fan of Star Wars, and because we had a few weeks off before our next semester of university started we thought it would be a good time to go through them. Before this week, I knew basically nothing about it. 

Disclaimer: I know that this is a well-loved and historical franchise, and I am by no means a film critic, but I thought it might be nice to see how someone with no skin in the game (so to speak) might rank them. (P.S. I have also been somewhat warned that I might get some flack for where I place the original trilogy. Please keep in mind that this is entirely a personal opinion!)

Here is how I’ve ranked it, from least favourite to favourite:

11) Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (Episode IX)

10) Rogue One: A Star Wars Story

9) Star Wars: The Last Jedi (Episode VIII)

8) Star Wars: The Force Awakens (Episode VII)

7) Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (Episode V)

6) Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (Episode VI)

5) Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (Episode III)

4) Star Wars: A New Hope (Episode IV)

3) Solo: A Star Wars Story

2) Star Wars: Attack of the Clones (Episode II)

For reference I never saw it on tv during college and watched it on Netflix back in 2016-2017 and did a full rewatch in 2020.

During Season 1, my friend would come over and watch Mandalorian. Now he's a Star Wars fan but only saw the movies. When season 1 ended with Gideon and the Darksaber, I like so many others lost it and he was very much ""Okay. it's a black lightsaber."" Then when we went to DenHe'ny's right before the pandemic hit, someone I know who was a server was talking Star Wars to us and was saying how he lost his shit at that scene. Again my friend wasn't in on it not seeing Clone Wars. So I gave him the CW lore behind it.

Throughout the year I showed him the Mon Cala arc for Ackbar and the first Hondo arc as he really loves scoundrels like our pirate entrepreneur, and Hondo was no exception. Then season 2 came and with episodes 3 and 5 I had to explain the significance of the characters in it, Now he enjoyed them.

During Mando S2 I was telling him he had to watch the show. My friend isn't one to get all of the streaming services (in addition to Mando, he'll be coming over for Marvel). So we agreed if I ever get it on DVD I'll loan it to him. As luck would happen, 2 weeks a go I found the Clone Wars seasons 1-5 set for $10 at Good Will (box was damaged but that was fine). The next day he came over and dropped it in front of him.

I did warn him we would not like Ahsoka (he isn't a fan of teenage as well as whiny characters in general) at first but told him to remember her in Mando and that it's all part of her growth. At first he wasn't sold on it but I told him to give it some more episodes.

He's almost done season 3 and loves it.

Plo Koon, Luminara, Aayla Secura, and Kit Fisto are his favorite Jedi, he loves the conflict that most Jedi see the clones as tools (I hinted about the Luminara arc). He also loves Rex. He's enjoyed that Dooku has more action compared to the movies. I've told him how the show does Maul great. I can't wait for him to get to the end of S5 and the start of S6.

He's mentioned he may do Disney Plus for a month and do S6/S7 and maybe Rebels.

I've told him some stuff about Rebels and I think he'll watch it too.

Anyway I figured you would all appreciate how I've brought an new member into the Clone Wars fold.",True,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1733896,public,spoiler,,,A friend's Mando/Clone Wars Journey,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kutnf4/a_friends_mandoclone_wars_journey/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spoilers ahead for those who haven’t read it.


This book is fucking amazing. The author does a fantastic job at developing even minor characters, and I was hooked in the first chapter. By the end of the chapter I was completely devastated by the loss of the Legacy Run, and throughout the entire book, each and every death felt meaningful. The singular issue I had with the novel was the introduction of too many characters that felt the same at first, although by around halfway through the book they each became distinct in my mind, with different powers, personalities, and motivations.


First up, the WORLDBUILDING. This era feels unique to the prequel era and the empire era, and the galaxy feels lived in. I loved the small references in how bacta isn’t completely developed yet, it really shows the progression of time between now and the prequels. I also love how they showed that the outer rim is even more ungoverned than it is in the movies, with even the hyperspace lanes not completely charted out yet. This book also brought politics and economics back into star wars, with the plot revolving around the shutting down of the hyperspace lane, the lore tidbits about Hetzal providing food to the inner planets, and the passage about the family from Alderaan moving to Elphrona to try and strike it rich mining.


The jedi feel very fleshed out as an order, and I LOVED the way their connections to the force are described. We’ve never really gotten that in any star wars media, so it was amazing to actually see how each jedi forges their own connection to the force. My personal favorite jedi have to be Kriss, Burry, Bell, and Greatstorm. They each care about doing the right thing, but in their own personal ways, rather than just “I am the perfect embodiment of good”. I also liked how when Jora Malli was talking to the council, all of the council members were engaged in a debate about what their place in combat was, and whether or not they should intervene with the republic’s affairs. It’s a nice contrast to the time of the prequels, where the jedi are basically an extension of the republic.


The nihil. Holy shit. They feel like such a new group of villains of which we’ve never really seen the likes of before. I was worried towards the beginning of the book that they’d feel like generic pirates, but was very pleased with the way they turned out. Marchion Ro is so threatening, and I love the way he at first seemed insecure or kinda incompotent at times, but then it was revealed that he had everything in control from the beginning. I loved the dynamic between him and Lourna Dee where he basically strangleholds her into serving him, taking away all of her other options and forcing her to stay within the organization.


Kassav and Marchion Ro’s dynamic is probably up there with one of the best things about this book. In the final fight in the nebula, when Kassav is thinking about betraying the nihil, then realizes he can’t and has to  stay, so then he reluctantly calls Marchion, who then helps him out and Kassav is rethinking his betrayal, BUT THEN Marchion utterly demonstrates his superiority and makes an example out of Kassav’s fleet, assuming control of the Path drives.  Beautifully written, amazing turn of events that left me biting my nails as to what would happen between the two of them.


Lastly, I would just like to praise the diversity in this book. We see SO MANY alien characters, and the author goes into detail about how they’re all unique with their own powers and cultures, but still all work together because We Are All The Republic. Also human diversity as well, we get so many great women and POC characters, as well as the San Tekka couple. And the novel doesn’t make a big deal about it, they are simply strong, fleshed out, interesting characters, who happen to not be straight white males. 


Overall, this book was an easy 10/10 for me, and I am very excited to see where the rest of the storyline of the High Republic goes from here.

I understand that most of you will prefer to watch it in release order, but somehow I think there's room for other legitimate options. The idea here is to jump between the PT and OT. 

TL;dr: 1,4,2,5,3,6

Episode 1: You're introduced to the Jedi, the Republic, the PT main characters and mostly just building the world. You learn about the Sith and how they want revenge on the Jedi.

Episode 4: you meet the OT main characters. You meet Luke, who has the same last name as Anakin, so you know they're related. Obiwan is a familiar name, he's old now and so you see that the movie takes place far into the future. Obiwan confirms that Anakin is Luke's father and that they fought together in the clone wars. You also see that the Galaxy is vastly different from the Galaxy introduced in episode 1, the Empire has taken over and there are no more Jedi.

Episode 2: you go to learn about how the clone wars started and what the role of the Jedi were in that conflict. They contribute to develop Anakin's character, and you become more interested in how powerful he is. 

Episode 5: At the beginning, obiwan tells Luke to find Yoda, the master of the Jedi Knight, and you're excited that Luke will learn from the best. At the end, the bomb drops, you find out Anakin is Darth Vader. You wonder how he fell to the dark side. You learn about the Emperor (they never mention his name, so Palpatine's identity is still a secret).

Episode 3: you finally get to see the fallout between Anakin and obiwan, the rise of the Empire, the identity of Palpatine, the fall of the Jedi, and sets up the beginning of episode 4. You learn about Leia being Luke's sister, which is going to be a surprise because up until now there were no indications of it.

Episode 6: the final conclusion and resolution of all the pieces set up in the previous 5 movies. The final battle is a lot more meaningful because you saw how the Empire ruined the Galaxy. 

So overall, I think this method still maintains a fair bit of the surprises and enriches the character development for a few main characters: namely Anakin and obiwan, but also Yoda and Palpatine.

Darksaber. They don’t have to retcon rebels. If you listen to moff Gideon closely he says “in order for her to wield the darksaber again she must win it in combat” key word being again. I’m thinking that the rules are the first time you get it, it can be gifted to you by the person who rightfully won it, as in Sabine. But if you loose the saber, you are dishonored and in order to regain your honor and the saber back you must avenge your first loss. I think the idea is that you take it back from the person who took it from you, at least in the creed, but this plays out interesting in terms of season 3.

The show in general. 

I find it annoying how a lot of plot points conveniently happened I get that tv shows aren’t as long as movies and so don’t go into as much depth but considering there are no commercials and no need to fit the show in a 30 min time slot it bothered me that the average runtime is 26 min. I feel a bunch needs to be explained:

Is boba like the Jesus of tattooine? Like he’s always there for important moments. Like he just happens to be tracking mando go take the bounty on Shand and then he has the money and resources to save her? 

Or how he’s just chilling watching mos pelgro awaiting what? We see him use his walking stick of doom on stormtroopers so ur telling me he couldn’t steal the armor from the dude wearing it or some little Jawas? 

Also how did he track mando to the Jedi planet? We know moff Gideon planted a tracker but we never see boba do anything on tattooine,  so how did he know then was a good time to just show up?

Also like when Ashoka says call out via the force, that makes sense bc we have seen it done before but they turned the force into a GPS system.

Here it is: 

Solo
Rouge 1
Episode 4
Episode 5
Episode 1 (semi optional)
Episode 2 (semi optional)
The clone wars series (optional)
Episode 3
Episode 6
The mandalorian series (optional)
Episode 7
Episode 8
Episode 9

*why this order?*

Allow me to explain this frakenstein of a playlist. 

So, we start with solo. Not only is this a very good movie in its own right, but i think its a good teaser and setup for characters to come. 

Next rouge 1, because it is basically what happens in the 2 days before episode 4 and ends *exactly* where 4 picks up. 

Next 5. Do i need to explain? Its ESB. 

Ok now we fo off the rails a little. I reccomend for this order you watch the prequel movies *here*. This is because right after we learn a very important plot point at the end of 5, we get to see these movies as a flashback to explain that plotpoint and its signifigance. Now, technically, you could just watch episode 3 and get all the info you need. And, slight spoiler, its the definitley best of the prequel trilogy. I still reccomend you watch episodes 1 and 2, and maybe even some of the clone wars animated series if you want to and arent in any rush. 

Now we cut back to episode 6, and witness the climax of the saga. After that, you have the option of watching the mandalorian, which is fantastic snd i highly reccomend. However, its optional for this run, because it doesnt have any plot points you need to see. Its, your call but youd still be missing out. Sorry to say though, but mando doesnt appear in the sequel trilogy, which is what you watch right after this.

I was pleasantly surprised with the speed of responses, but with 102 responses and a sharp drop in the time between responses, I closed the survey around noon my time. So here's the analysis of my results. If you want to see the raw numbers or pie charts about the responses you can find those [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-JPvwwuGkBd0_qsePwxUH2sQOWZZ490Br3sGV_b6sMc/edit?usp=sharing)

Now the reason why this is called the ""Optimal Star Wars Movie Night"" survey is because I was trying to figure out which movie could be chosen for a hypothetical fandom wide movie night, using a voting system like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orybDrUj4vA&amp;ab_channel=CGPGrey). Basically, which option would upset the least amount of people.

So which will it be? 0 of the respondents said they hated **The Empire Strikes Back**. The entire OT got overwhelming positive responses. 1 person said they hated A New Hope, and honestly I could write an entire paragraph making a hypothesis about why they responded the way they did. I was one of two people who said they hated **Return of the Jedi,** and I will write rants about it on command. (The other person was the ANH hater)

For a prequel trilogy movie night, the optimal choice would be **Revenge of the Sith** (4.9% hated). For a sequel trilogy movie, it's **The Force Awakens** (8.8% hated). For the Disney era films as a whole its **Rogue One** (2.9% hated). That's also the case for the side films. However the Clone Wars started doing a lot worse when once I posted the survey to r/movies, and it wasn't just with mehs, which could have been a reflection of how I didn't think to make all the questions optional because it was a commenter who later suggested posting it to r/movies. 

The most hated movie of them all is **The Rise of Skywalker** (46.1% hated). Surprisingly, **Attack of the Clones** (25.5% hated) is the worst received prequel film (I was expecting it to be TPM). **Solo** (14.7%) is the most hated of the side films.

The ""meh"" responses didn't create a spoiler effect and the result for the most hated film and least loved film in each category was the same. Same for least hated and most loved. It's just the specific numbers that are different, which I linked in the first paragraph.  

The most neutrally regarded film of them all was **The Phantom Menace** (63.7% meh). **Return of the Jedi** was the most neutrally received OT film (9.8% meh). **The Force Awakens** has both the most meh and most loved of the sequel trilogy films (44.1% meh, 47.1% loved). **Solo** (49% meh) is the second most meh film of the entire franchise and the most meh Disney Era film.

I also tried to figure out which films were the most polarizing, through a non-precise comparison of  which films had the most non-meh responses and the smallest difference between the number of ""hated it"" and ""loved it"" responses. It was **The Last Jedi** (38.2% loved, 41.2% hated). The other ones had such high meh amounts that the loves and hates didn't feel close enough to be considered polarizing, but they were the ones with the lowest difference between the two. That's **Attack of the Clones** (18.6% loved, 25.5% hated) and **Solo** (36.6% loved, 14.7% hated). And because of the hilarious good approval rate of the OT, **Return of the Jedi** (88.2% loved, 2% hated). 

Anyway those are the results of the survey.

Then, out of the blue, he asks the biggest Star Wars nerd he knows to watch all the movies with him. 

We began with 4 and 5 and then we watched the prequels and then 6, 7, 8, 9. The reason I chose this order was because it puts Vader in a different light. Before the prequels, my friend saw Vader as the embodiment of evil with no decent bone in his body. Then he learned who Anakin was. The boy who wanted to see every star and defeat the Sith. Then that boy became the face of evil. 

Once we got back to 6, we're armed with the knowledge that this villain was once a very strong jedi. He was told he killed the love of his life, he murdered his mentor and best friend, and undergone incredibly painful surgery after he was left for dead. And now his son, who learned the ways of the jedi and has been evading his capture for the past past 2 movies is face to face with his master, The Emperor. 

When Vader decided to help his son and *supposedly* kill his master, we see the rebirth of Anakin Skywalker, finally getting a conclusion to one of the best redemption arcs in fiction. My friend went from knowing Vader as the nigh unbeatable dark warrior to the sad, broken jedi who lost everything.

The OG Star Wars at its time was like a mix between a campy action adventure and an experimental art film. Empire is a movie about a dude becoming a Tibetan monk with a wild alien in a swamp with a climax that is straight up like a Maury Povich paternity reveal. They are bizarre movies and way different than your typical blockbusters. 

ROTJ and the prequels are pretty much standard action serials, but yeah just watch them there are tons of weird George Lucas ideas. And while these may be much lower quality than Empire, they still have some of that OG Star Wars charm. 

The thing these movies have in common is that they are indie movies. Empire, ROTJ, and the prequels were all produced by George Lucas himself, there weren't any studio execs with their hands on the movies. The only exception is the original 1977 Star Wars , which was literally a low budget B movie that nobody thought would be a success. 

If you compare this to the Disney Sequels, the contrast is huge. It's apparent there is a ton of studio involvement in these movies. Like clockwork these movies follow the MCU formula regarding the pacing of dumb side jokes and action scenes. Not only that but everything is dumbed down, they use the classic iconography as a marketing ploy, but these movies turned Star Wars into Marvel movies with a new coat of paint. 

Releasing a new Star Wars movie every year for a 5 year stretch on top of a plethora of Stars Wars shows just shows how these are factory made.

Thirty years after the final death of Palpatine and the destruction of the First Order's power things are at a uneasy quiet. What remains of the First Order is more of a faction than an empire and is nowhere near what it once was in power, after the death of many of its leaders it is much less ambitious than it once was. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Rebellion, now just called the Alliance is not too much better off than the First Order. They still struggle to recover from the heavy losses they took during the First Order's reign. The respect they once had is dwindling and following the death of their leader Poe Dameron they are in even more turmoil. They struggle just to maintain their contacts and allies. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Mandalorians attempt to rebuild Mandalore but the process is slow and the tensions between the ""Old Ones"" and the ""Helmetless"" are skyrocketing. Divided and angry Mandalore is split between two ideals. A third party emerges trying to end the conflict by supporting an idea of both ideal being allowed and respected. Instead of helping this just makes the conflict turn even darker. Although no all out wars are fought the hostility between the three groups are rising.

&amp;#x200B;

And as all this this happens the Jedi are returning, but not in the expected way. Although there is a slight increase in Jedi from the Light Side, the Grey Jedi are growing much, much faster. Despite the growth, the Jedi are not growing in number as much as either side would hope.

I have some thoughts, probably too many, and this is not even all of them.

- Ahsoka: What they did with her character is just incredible. As someone coming from the old canon, I was extremely skeptical about Anakin suddenly having a Padawan during the Clone Wars, but it's safe to say they made Ahsoka into one of the best (and one of my favorite) characters in this franchise. Particularly the way they've worked her seamlessly into every era. I knew she was going to leave the Jedi Order eventually because that part had been spoiled for me through the years, but it was still heartbreaking to see how it all happened. And then again when she faced off against Anakin. Also I find it funny to read know about how much people debated whether or not she was alive - I think if I had seen that then, I wouldn't have doubted that she was alive at all, but I also had the benefit of having seen her show up in The Mandalorian already.

- Maul: The other big surprise for me. I only found out Maul was alive when I saw Solo in theaters, and it was another plot point I initially found very annoying (bringing back a character who was almost certainly dead). However, his character arc was also incredibly done. His unending rage toward Obi-Wan. That final confrontation. 

- The Clone Wars: In general, just what an epic. There were so many high points, so much good character development. The final season that came out this year is the one that stands out to me the most - it's amazing to see how they weaved the show into the events of Episode 3. I actually watched a ""Fulcrum Cut"" that spliced together the last 4 episodes and ROTS and it was an *incredible* piece of Star Wars media. The scene in the ship where Ahsoka can sense Anakin falling to the Dark Side is one of the most heartbreaking in the franchise, and possibly my favorite.

- Rebels: Started off kinda slow but I liked the story between Kanan and Ezra, and then it built up into much more. I loved the relationship between them and the fact that Kanan was not trying to train Ezra as strict Jedi. Similarly, I liked that you could really see the development of Ezra's abilities from the beginning to the end of the show, and sometimes even episode to episode. It was nice to see his progression and also to see a Jedi character that isn't constantly struggling with his abilities. I also really liked in the later seasons how they showed the Rebellion coming together from many other smaller rebel cells, it's something I'd always wanted to see in Star Wars. I rewatched Rogue One right after finishing the series, and it really made the movie feel like a Rebels episode. They did a great job in that last season of dropping hints and leading up to the events of R1.

- Kanan: Man, I just didn't see it coming (Jedi Night). This was one spoiler I had not had spoiled for me before the show and it's one of the few times I've cried during Star Wars. I loved Kanan's character and the progression of his story. 

- Complaints: Not many. The biggest one may be the World Between Worlds. That whole business was pretty cool conceptually, but it wasn't very Star Wars to me. I'm glad it resulted in Ahsoka being saved but I don't like the idea of introducing time travel shenanigans into SW. Thrawn I was also kind of disappointed in (as an old-EU Thrawn fan). He just felt like... a kids show version of Thrawn. I don't know. I think it was just the voice was wrong for the character IMO. And finally I would mention filler episodes, which whatever! The only ones that stick in my head are when I was approaching the endgame of Clone Wars and it hits you with that fucking Droid Arc. I didn't want to skip any episodes in this watch through but I got close then lol.

- Pronounciations: One more totally inconsequential thing is how many different pronunciations there are in this show for the same word/name. One on hand I thought of it as poor quality control, but I figure even IRL people pronounce things differently (and wrong) all the time. Still I thought it was funny.

Frequently asked counter arguments
Q: its not the ""republic way"" to bombard the a planet
A: its not a planet, its just a factory, a big one actually so the factory will be easily to be spotted and be destroyed. Plus, the base delta zero code is also on the military of the republic, mainly used as a last resort but, its not a planet we are leaving to smeethereens, its just a factory

Q: civilian casualties
A: there could be some to no civilians in the factory, there are only some separtist leaders, droids, geonosian hive soldiers (who are hostile anyways) and possibly a few separtist tourists there, if they gave tourists a visit the area, this could pose an alternative solution to shutting down the ray shields by spies dressed as tourists and probably split off from the group and shut the ray shields down. If there are no such tourists visiting the place then the current plan has to be implemented.

Q: geonosian hive bugs
A: those bugs are controlled by a hive mind anyways and all those bugs are hostile, plus, if the queen below the surface of the factory is killed off from the bombardment, i mean like, there are multiple queen geonosian bugs that can sustain the population...

On TV Tropes ""fridge brilliance"" section for the movie, they've explained that  ""Rey calling herself ""Rey Skywalker"" at the end of the film is not about rejecting her Palpatine lineage (as she does see her parents in a positive light during the climax) in favor of her surrogate family but to save the legacy of the Skywalkers that Sidious worked so hard to destroy since corrupting Anakin Skywalker. With all the Skywalkers dead and unable to make up for their family sins despite being a family of heroes, Rey taking up their name will ensure that the Skywalkers will still live on in spirit, even if the physical blood is gone.

It was the first star wars movie I got to see in theatres and it was with my father on opening day. I remember absolutely loving the movie. Rey, finn and Poe where all really charming and likeable characters. I thought the plot was interesting with Luke missing and every desperate to find him, including the villians. I also thought Starkiller Base was terrifying. I was also in a very dark place at the time, I was beginning to go down the alt right side of the internet, as a result I instantly connected with Kylo Ren. Especially during the walkway scene where we really see how split he was between light and dark.

This movie single handedly made me a Star Wars fan. I had dabbled in the series from time to time. Mostly just watching whatever episode of Clone Wars was being played on ABC3. But The Force Awakens made me a life long fan.

When The Last Jedi came out I was super excited, I had just finished high school and was at my worst when it came to my alt right angst and Depression. After finishing school I felt totally bereft of purpose and felt totally lost. When i first watched the movie i felt a little uncertain how i felt about it. But upon rewatching it at home i can say that I love it too. I really connect to all the heroes in this movie. Before I just felt like they were cool but in Last Jedi I felt so much more for them. Rey hoping someone will tell her what she is but has to decide her own fate, Poe learning to become a real leader and Finn finding something to fight for. I particularly relate to finn here because right after this movie came out I started to free myself from the alt right and realise how wrong I was. 

By the end of 2019 I had been looking for a job for 2 years straight and never found any. But I had been considering go to film school. However I felt like I wouldnt have what it takes to go to a uni. So when i watched Rise of Skywalker and saw Rey and Poe struggling with the same imposter syndrome I was feeling it really hit me emotionally. I cried when during the Han scene, was terrified of the undead palpatine and was always at the edge of my seat the whole time. After seeing it I was so full of happy emotion I just couldn't stop talking about it. I even took my friend to see it. It was the first time I had seen a movie twice in theatres. We both had a great time. 

As of know I am one year into my film degree and am happier then ever. The Sequels matter to me so much because they have been with me through the most troubled part of my life and served as some of my biggest comforts and inspirations to keep going.

I know this may all seem silly to some of you but this is honestly how I feel. These three movies mean alot to me. Thier Characters, Thier Worlds, Thier Stories and they are one of my inspirations to pursue film and TV as a career. I Hope you all get to see what I have in mind in a decade or so.

In regard to my dad who watched all these movies with me. He like Force Awakens, Was only Okay with Last Jedi but absolutely loved Rise of Skywalker. We are now watching every episode of Mando together. He cried at the scene where grogu left with Luke.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1732947,public,self,,,Why I Love the Sequel Trilogy.

And in the last hour of the video he narrates an alternate Sequel Trilogy if it were, well... actually written well/with love and care. And the experience of hearing the plot line, the narration he gave for it. By God, was it immensely satisfying to watch, it had me at the grip of my seats staring at the screen (even though visually there was almost nothing to see. It was that good).  


So I've been wondering, do people know of any other videos out there where other creators have narrated/made a spectacle of their own sequel trilogy's to replace the version that Disney handed us? Because I have to admit, it both saddens me greatly that the version I just watched will never be made into a movie trilogy, but it also left me extremely hungry for more reimaginings.  


And yes, I know I can pick up Legends books, read over the Jacen and Jaina Solo series. But those being official fictions are pretty easy to track down, acquire and read through. I'm more making this thread because Indie-created reimaginings wouldn't have the same publishing or sharing power, so they could likely be buried.   


Note, I'm well aware from skimming this subreddits threads before that a sizable portion of this subreddit are big fans of the Disney trilogy and extremely defensive (and hostile) to anyone who disliked it. I'm not really eager to get dragged into Internet stand-off about needing to defend why I dislike the Disney trilogy (especially since most likely. Anything I say won't even be heard).

The acting and lines can be somewhat cringey (mostly AOTC), and the most egregiously written character of all was Anakin in AOTC which portrayed him only as an unlikable, creepy, thirsty, shallow teenager, and some of Hayden's line deliveries *really* didn't land (like ""I HATE THEM!"". I burst out laughing). The pacing of AOTC can also be a slog, but it picks up in the third act. There's really not much character development for Anakin in the first two, except his mother dying, despite his development needing to be the predominant focus. A lot happens on screen yet not that much of the overarching plot moves with it. I can understand why some say the first two are useless, I think you could easily stitch the first half of TPM with the middle of AOTC with the last half of ROTS and not much would change.

But I'll be darned if it's not all so *alive*. The world moves so naturally, every planet, creature and element is bursting with life. It feels like even if you're not looking at them they'd still be moving. And neither the CGI nor the politics were bothersome for me at all, I actually enjoyed them, because it felt so original. What I admire most of all about the prequel trilogy is that despite being the same world as the OT it's not tripping over itself to show you that. It's completely original despite being grounded in the same world as Luke and the Death Star. It's doing its own thing but you're along for the ride and I love it so much. Only by the end of ROTS when Vader is born does it feel like the OT, and it's closer to feeling like a homage than anything.

Now I have multiple biases - I'm very nostalgic, especially for the music, characters, actors, world, etc. - but I think it can't be overstated how much peoples' expectations got in the way of them enjoying it. And hell, a lot of the OT is bloated with filler and stupid throwaways. But I genuinely don't believe they are ""bad movies"" and they're extremely Star Warsy. Again I can understand how it poorly sets up the OT, but without thinking about that they're a lot of fun. I don't even mind Jar Jar. Despite their shortcomings I think they're all mostly solid and I give TPM 8/10, AOTC 6.5/10, and ROTS 7.5/10. Unfortunately Anakin's characterization weighs them down a bit, and I can sympathize with the expectations of ""This is supposed to be Darth Vader"". Not enough substantial development for him and they shouldn't have left the vast majority of plot development for the 3rd film. I think if another writer reined George in they'd be near masterpieces. TPM might be my favorite out of the 3, I have very few issues with it; contrary to popular opinion I found the acting to be manageable and the midichlorians controversy way overblown, I mean come on, it's just a measurement of force power. Silly but by no means problematic.

Am I crazy and alone? Anyone else feel this way? It could just be that I'm accustomed to the hate they get, and I'm blind with nostalgia, or is it both sides that are blind?

In the old canon Anakin had only one real friend his age group,   Darra Thel-Tanis, sadly it got a bit tragic.

That's in my opinion his only true friendship with another padawan in what is now legends.

From what I've seen in the new comics all the other padawan's are dicks to him, which is a big contrast to the old one where he was a dick. 

Does he have any geniune friendships in the new cannon or does every other padawan give him crap?

YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ THE FOLLOWING:

I really like this anakin being more of a victim of his situation and being constantly ostrisised by his peers, it shows a bit more depth on the character making him even question if he actually wants to be a jedi, and what his place in the order is. Its a good set up in my opinion to the anakin we see in AOC and later in Clone Wars. In contrast to legends where he activly pushed people away by being an asshole and feeling superior, but he actually managed to develop a geniune friendship with Darra (this version of anakin actually kinda reminds me of Dooku in jedi lost). But idk I just like new padawan anakin better you actually see him try and be part of the order but is being pushed away by its members.

Don't get me wrong, I fucking love the reveal sequence in the Mandalorian. It's everything the selfish part of me wanted from Luke, and everything the rational part of me knew he shouldn't exhibit, in TLJ. Let me explain.

Cast your mind back to before TLJ came out. I walked into that film not knowing what to expect, but knowing we were finally going to see Jedi Master Luke Skywalker in live action, played by the man himself. And there was a selfish, childish part of me that wanted to see Luke just *unleash* \-- really show on screen why he's known as the most powerful Jedi to have ever lived. Singlehandedly fight Snoke and Kylo at the same time and beat them with one hand. Fight the First Order singlehandedly with his 'laser sword', as he says. But I knew, going in, that if I got that, it would be *wrong*. 'Fully realized Jedi Master Luke Skywalker' wouldn't engage in such a reckless and excessive display. And while I have issues with TLJ, one thing I think they got absolutely correct is Luke's final 'showdown' with Kylo. In his final moments, Luke completely embraced, completely *surrendered himself*, to the Jedi ideals of self-sacrifice, defense, and passivity. Without taking a single life, Luke saved what remained of the Resistance, clowned Kylo and the entire First Order, and inspired a galaxy without hope. And the part of me that wanted to see some crazy display of power from him was *still* satisfied, as we got to see him astral project himself *across the fucking galaxy*.

Compare it to his 'Rogue One moment' in the Mandalorian. It was awesome, it was badass, it was excessive. I don't object to that, not at all, it even makes sense. Luke may be a 'Master' at this point, but still, much to learn, he has. Fresh (relatively) off the destruction of the Death Star, the redemption of Vader, and the fall of the Empire, it's easy to understand why Luke might be full of confidence at this point. And like I said -- goddamn, it was cool. But for me, Luke's defining 'Jedi Master moment' will be at the end of The Last Jedi, where he truly gave himself to the ideals Yoda and Obi-Wan taught him.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1732253,public,self,,,"Luke's Mandalorian moment was epic, but his Last Jedi 'fight' was his crowning Jedi Master moment -- fight me.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/ku4tho/lukes_mandalorian_moment_was_epic_but_his_last/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kylo paints a picture of Luke as a frightened and jealous Master who was standing over him as he slept, prepared to bring the killing stroke with an ignited saber in his hand.

Luke paints a picture of a conflicted Uncle watching his nephew follow in his father's footsteps toward the dark side. He may have simply been meditating over Kylo, waiting to confront him, when Kylo roused and brought the ceiling down on him. Luke's recollection ends with him shouting ""Ben, no!"" as if he were trying to save him.

Kylo is an unreliable narrator, sharing this story with Rey to try to get her to turn to the dark side. He has every incentive and inclination to embellish his story to paint Luke in a bad light and deceive her, but so many people accept his retelling as fact, and hate Luke. 

Luke's monologue to Rey about the failures of the Jedi exposed his motivations. He had become so enthralled with the greatness of his own mythology that he believed that his mission to resurrect the Jedi order was essentially guaranteed. Being attacked and defeated by his nephew and the cult of dark padawans which had formed right under his nose was the last straw. He withdrew, just like Yoda and, to a lesser extent, Obi Wan.

Kylo Ren successfully deceived the audience, in the same way he sought to deceive Rey.

I'm sure there are a lot of holes even with guides &amp; that generally most of these questions can be summed up with ""the writers just chose things at random"" so speculation is also helpful for a more in-universe look.

___________________

The basics are rather simple.

* CT = Clone Trooper, your basic infantry guys like Fives &amp; Echo.
* CC = Clone Commander, like Cody, Bly, Bacara, etc
* RC = Republic Commando, like Delta Squad members or Omega Squad (but only in Legends as of now)
* ARC = Advanced Recon Commando, like Fordo, Fives, etc.

But... that's just a rough guideline because then they get weird.

For instance, Rex is a captain &amp; is given the designation C*T*-7567, implying that even Clone Captain gets CT &amp; that CC is reserved purely for the Clone Commanders as listed above. However, Gregor is a commando and also a captain yet he's give the C*C* prefix. Why? As a Commando, he *should* be RC based on Legends but even ignoring Legends, why is he CC &amp; not CT? Both he and Rex share the same rank, so now the idea is that CC can be either Clone Commander *or* Commando?

We know that ARCs are listed as both ARC &amp; whatever their other designation is. For example, Fives is referred to as ARC-5555 in the Umbara story arc, similar to how Legends' Fordo is usually referred to as ARC-77. Later, in the Order 66 story arc, Fives is referred to as *CT*-5555, his original designation, similar to how Legends' Alpha is usually referred to as Alpha-17 or A-17. We can assume that the same would apply to them: ARC-77 or A-77; A-17 or ARC-17.

____________________

It gets even weirder when we get to the numbers. At first glance, they seem rather simple: ARC-5555, CT-7567, CC-2224, CC-1138, and so on. So whatever letters apply to the rank or role followed by four digits.

But that's *also* not always the case. For example, as far we know, Rex &amp; Cody's designations are just CT-7567 &amp; CC-2224 respectively, in both Legends and Canon. They fit the pattern. But Fives &amp; Echo's full designations are CT-27-5555 &amp; Echo's designation changed -- it was originally CT-21-0408 then became CT-1409. So why do they both have two extra preceding digits before the ""main"" four &amp; why did Echo's change (outside the obvious answer of it being either a mistake or simple retcon lol). Maybe they indicate a batch or group... or perhaps the extra two digits indicate that they're STILL in training? Still doesn't explain why Gives keeps the rest of his designation while Echo's changed. However, adding Gregor to the mix complicates the matter further because *his* designation is CC-5576-39. The two extra digits are at the *end* now.

Early Legends sources also were a bit wonky too with slash marks, multiple hyphens, etc. For instance, Deviss' designation was CT-65/91-6210. Shatterpoint features both CC-8/349 (a *captain* not a Commander or Commando) as well as CRC-09/571 (a ""Clone regimental commander"" which implies the letter part of the designation should be an abbreviation of *whatever* the rank is, even if there may be some overlaps like Clone Captain or Clone Commander which works with the other clone in the story as well as ARCs in both Legends &amp; Canon, Legends' Republic Commandos as RC, and even Gregor having CC as a captain... but we know that's not the case with Rex)

Let's not debate whether or not we should reboot it but imagine HOW we can do it immersively.

I'm just wanna talk about the possibility of changing/rebooting the movie. Here's my take: 

After watching the Mandalorian season 2 I realized it is pretty clear that Luke will meet Ahsoka. What if Ahsoka introduce Ezra to Luke and because of that, Ezra teaches Luke how to access the world between worlds. In that place you can see events from not only the past but also the future. Maybe Luke can learn what happens in the sequel trilogy timeline and learn from the mistakes he will make and decide to be better. And because of this now we are on a new timeline, seperate from the sequel trilogy but is every bit as canon as the sequel trilogy. And maybe we can have a brighter future in the star wars universe: perhaps Luke will find and train Rey earlier and maybe we'll see a Ben Solo who's never turned to the dark side.

I was just watching season two of The Clone Wars on Disney+, and I came up with a little theory:

In the episode 'Children of the Force,' we see Cad Bane kidnap Force sensitive children and Darth Sidious and his troops perform experiments on them. He says that he envisions 'A group of Sith spies, spying every corner of the Galaxy.' 

I was wondering if the Empire had captured Grogu for a similar reason. 

In Mando S2, we see the Dark Troopers kidnap Grogu from the rock at Tython, and in the season finale, we hear Gideon say that 'they've taken what they wanted' from Grogu. 

In the episode 'The Siege,' we see Dr.Pershing's recorded message, in which he mentions about Grogu's M-count, and says they couldn't find a better donor. 

So, my theory is that Gideon and the Empire are gonna use Grogu's blood to breed a new generation of these Sith spies that Sidious mentioned.

We don’t know when or what this movie is about but there have been some hints that it could explore the origins of the Jedi. 

December 2027: Fiege’s movie - we first heard about this prior to TROS but a couple days ago we heard that a writer had been hired. We know literally nothing about this movie apart from rumours that some marvel actors will be brought across.

The problem with this is that the writing teams are already announced for the latter 2 movies despite being years off, especially Fiege’s movie. We heard that Michael Waldron (the writer) will not be as heavily involved in Loki season 2 (release probably in 2023) due to his involvement with the Star Wars project.

[Social Thinking: Crash Course Psychology #37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6HLDV0T5Q8&amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOPRKzVLY0jJY-uHOH9KVU6&amp;index=38)

I watched this video for a psychology class last semester and it really caught my attention. In short, it talks about how universal human behavior works and how we think when in social situations.

Throughout the video, they talk about Darth Vader and the psychological events that took place to cause him to turn from ""Go get 'em Anakin"" to Dark Lord of the Sith.

The video's essential question is ""Did Darth Vader throw Emperor Palpatine down the reactor shaft because of his personality, or because of his situation?""

To start the discussion, it talks about the **""foot-in-the-door"" phenomenon**, which is when someone becomes more compliant to a large request after agreeing to smaller favors. 

\- Anakin is a loyal Jedi Knight who faithfully wishes to serve his purpose in the Order, but after his slaughter of the Tusken Raiders in EP II, he becomes more suggestible to his darker tendencies. 

\- Afterwards in EP III, he is plagued with nightmares about Padmé's potential death, only increasing his darker nature. In desparation, he causes bigger and bigger atrocities to save her life. These actions cause him to change his beliefs ""about himself, and others.""

After becoming Darth Vader and learning of Padmé's death, he believes Palpatine is the only thing he has left, so he serves him faithfully for over two decades. He then murders people who would even think about rebelling against the Empire, and he feels no conscience, loss, guilt, or love of any kind.

Later in the video, they bring up a concept of **Cognitive Dissonance**, which is when tension is caused by a person's actions and beliefs contradicting one another. The person experiencing that dissonance is then left wanting to resolve that tension. ""It is what turns an Anakin into a Darth Vader, and if we're lucky, back into an Anakin."" 

\- Anakin's dark deeds caused him to change his beliefs from a kind-hearted Jedi Knight into a terrifying mass murderer. 

\- After his son, Luke Skywalker emerges, he rediscovers his love once again. Tension is caused once again because he is now this homicidal monster who destroys entire planets for the sake of his Empire, and yet he still loves his family. He then resolves that tension by killing the Emperor, cementing his identity as Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Knight once again.

What do you think about this? Do you agree with the points I've made, or do you believe something different?

* Originally the opening of the film with Anakin and Obi-Wan trying to “save” Palpatine was going to be an hour long. This hour long version includes a much longer space fight, a battle with General Grievous and some battle droids on the ship, a scene with Anakin and Obi-Wan trying to translate R2 by speaking his language, a slightly longer fight with Dooku, and a scene in which Anakin and Obi-Wan are trying to get Palpatine off the ship while avoiding battle Droids.
* There was a cut subplot in the film with 3-4 scenes that shows Padmé, Bail Organa, Mon Mothma and other senators forming the committee of 2,000 who signed the delegation of 2,000, which was a delegation against all the constitutional amendments Palpatine was making, giving him emergency powers.
* After Mace Windu was blasted out of the window Palpatine was going to tell Anakin that he manipulated the Midi-chlorians to create him. This was cut because Lucas felt it was too similar to the twist of Darth Vader being Luke’s father.
* During Order 66 Anakin would be shown fighting Cin Drallig as he tries to protect two padawans, Whie Malreaux and Bene, Anakin eventually kills all three of them. Bene would have died by being stabbed through the neck. This showed up as hologram security footage.
* Anakin also would have stabbed Shaak Ti in the back during Order 66.
* When Obi-Wan and Yoda arrive at the Jedi temple they were going to be met with Clones in Jedi robes, the “Jedi” said that they reclaimed the temple from the Clones, because Obi-Wan and Yoda aren’t blind that kill all the Clones.
* The original battle on Mustafar was much longer at first and included Obi-Wan getting both sabers, after the fight Anakin would have said “Help me” before burning (the dialogue was cut but Anakin’s lips still movie) and Obi-Wan declines causing Anakin’s eyes to turn sith orange/red and he would then scream “I hate you!”
* Not really a cut scene but cut dialogue, while Yoda was meditating at the end of the film he was supposed to be talking to Qui-Gon Jinn about becoming a force ghost, but Liam Neeson is expensive so this was covered in more detail on The Clone Wars. 
* We would have seen Yoda’s and his ship arrive on Dagobah and the door open.

The reason I ask this is because Anakin (as we're all aware from the prequels) had a very high midichlorian count, and this was the source for a lot of his power. However, after the battle of Mustafar, Anakin lost his limbs, consequently of course has less cells in his body, and therefore, lost a lot of his midichlorian count (which I assume would affect his abilities and make him far weaker). 

However, once Anakin is put into the suit and really becomes Darth Vader, he is of course very powerful and skilled in combat. I understand that the suit probably gives him additional powers, but don't you think having less midichlorians would have made him weaker and less powerful with the Force in combat situations? 

Maybe I'm just over-thinking it, but hey, if anyone can try to give me an in-universe of why this is?

Luke turns it on, swings it around a little, goes ""huh neat"" and the goes back to plot advancement dialogue. We next see Obi-Wan use his in the Cantina. Luke gets a little practice in on the Falcon then turns it off never to be used again.

When Luke, Han, Chewie and Leia are running around having a gun fight its just that a gun fight. We do see him still wearing it around but its it kind of funny that that's it. Its not until the next entire movie when he cracks open the Yeti and the AT-AT walker that we ever see just how useful it is.

A hand to hand storm trooper or maybe an officer with one or something. Even cutting open the cell to the Princess might make sense. Or during the escape, ""here Princess we are short on guns so take mine I'll use my father's sword because why else would I have been given it"". Its like being getting the sword of time in Legend of Zelda then defeating the game with a boomerang. Yeah I know you can but its weird.

Yes I know it the vast hordes of expanded cannon both approved and no longer approved he uses it all over the shop. But within that first movie nothing.

That's why there's only one choice for live action Thrawn. Sure many actors could make a great Thrawn but let's not get carried away by rumors of RDJ or Benedict Cumberbatch. 

The thing that stood out the most to me in Mando was Katee Sackoff playing Bo Katan. It was perfect. The look, movements, emotion, and acting were flawless. That's because she has already been Bo Katan, she is Bo Katan. 

This is why Lars is the only real choice. He knows Thrawn, he is the voice of Thrawn and can easily be made to look like Thrawn. Plus, the most important part of Thrawn is his voice and the way it expressed subtle shifts in emotion. Something we know Lars can do. So even if he wasn't a top tier screen actor (which he is), it wouldn't matter since we know he can do the voice acting and stand still on screen.

Anyway, rant done.

I’ve recently been drawn into the expanded universe of Star Wars, especially trying to grasp all the stories set within the current canon.

I’ve watched Mando, Rebels and TCW and all the movies
I’ve played Fallen Order but not much else

I’d definitely be interested in playing more games but I’m really wondering if anyone would be interested in helping me sift through the books that have been written so that I could make the most out of them. I don’t have a ton of free time so I’d like to prioritize what’s considered “the best of the best” and start from there. 

What’s sparked my interest is definitely Thrawn and the new release of The High Republic book, I just don’t know where to start.

Even The Mandalorian doesn't evade this.

It's time for a new enemy in Star Wars, one that is not run by, related to, secretly controlled by, or orchestrated by Palpatine in any way, shape, or form. I propose for this role, the Jedi Empire.

The Jedi Empire begins when one of Luke's students reads about the history of the Prequels, and decides that the Jedi's apathy to politics was the downfall of the Republic. Instead of using their wisdom to guide it, they sat back and let worlds fall at the hands of corrupt politicians, and didn't even notice when their own greatest enemy got elected. The Jedi's apoliticality was the direct cause of the Clone Wars and the Empire that succeeded it. This time, if the Republic is not to fall, the Jedi must use their wisdom to rule it.

And so the first Jedi Empire was born. Led by Grand Master Luke Skywalker, the Jedi Council becomes the supreme governing body of the Republic. Its Imperial Knights are faithful guardians of the Light, purging the Dark Side from all corners of the galaxy. But after a crisis, Luke Skywalker realizes that they are merely the Light reflection of the Sith Empire - not its opposite. Betrayed by his own mentor, Luke's student casts him out and assumes control of the Jedi Council himself, declaring Luke to have turned to the Dark Side, with himself as the keeper of the Light.

Abandoned by his students and his Jedi Order, Luke Skywalker must consult with his old masters and gather a new generation of allies to take back the Republic... and democracy.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1730387,public,self,,,I'd really like to see a Jedi Empire as a Star Wars villainous faction.,0,[],0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kthsfc/id_really_like_to_see_a_jedi_empire_as_a_star/,,all_ads,6,,,,7f27565c-a79a-11e5-8a26-0ead5e3ed807,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without going into too much detail, it really captured what I had hoped a ""High Republic"" vibe would be, and I thought it was a thoroughly enjoyable read with some surprisingly emotional moments. The characters were excellent on the whole, but at times there were a few too many to keep full track of. Having said that, I assume this book is doing a lot of leg work to introduce characters that will remain important throughout the new literature, so it's understandable that a lot was going on. I also enjoyed the antagonists (who shall remain nameless) a lot more than I thought I would. 

If I had one other criticism, it's that it felt like it borrowed a bit too much from Star Trek: Discovery, as weird as that may sound. 

I'm disappointed (but not surprised) by the toxicity from much of the fanbase when it comes to the High Republic in general. The criticisms (I imagine largely from people who haven't read the book nor will read the impending comics / books) seem to centre around (a) ""it's Kathleen's baby so it'll suck"" and (b) ""it's SJW cringe"". 

Both of those points of view are tiresome and cringeworthy in themselves. The idea of this book being SJW cringe (which I've seen on some clickbaity thumbnails) I assume comes from the fact that (1) the Order and the Republic have a largely positive outlook - which I personally feel is an essential part of this era's tone anyway, and (2) there are a mixture of alien races, genders, and in one briefly mentioned case - sexualities, all sharing the limelight. If that's a problem, you're not really a Star Wars fan at all.

It wasn’t the full movie but from my memory it was the battle on star killer, in my brains version of the movie, the resistance was experiencing a bit of a loss, not that big of one, and they called in for backup, they were getting leverage over the first order and one single X-wing flew in, Poe delivered the line “one x-wing? It’ll do” (I assume my brain was in a way referencing Mandalorian) Poe watched as the X-wing with old markings flew past and down to the surface.

It cuts to Han confronting Kylo, Kylo hands Han the lightsaber for him to grip onto with him, Ben was about to return to the light, until “Ben!” Can be heard combing from luke in the distance, Kylo is filled with anger by the sound of the voice and ignites the lightsaber into Han. And Kylo turns to look at luke, still with the blade stabbed into Han. Han gets okie last look at Luke, and Luke gets one last look at Han....and then Kylo throws him over the edge....

In the beginning, he’s whiny, naive, and sometimes annoying to watch.

In the second movie, not much has changed. With Yoda, he is reluctant to put in work to train, constantly complaining, and in one of the greatest scenes in movie history(opinion), when Vader says, “I am your father,” he denies it, and is afraid.

It’s the third movie, after all his training with Yoda, where he grows as a character. He doesn’t whine, he doesn’t complain, and is a great warrior. All this so that he could face his father, and find the good within him, and in that moment, that young and afraid farmboy comes out for just a moment, as he finds the strength to beat the dark side.

All of this is why I would call Luke one of my favorite characters in fiction, because of his growth. He started from the bottom and eventually turned into a great Jedi.

Years after the Empire, Luke rebuilds the Jedi Order, and trained many young padawans. The reason I don’t like Luke in the sequels is because it’s almost as if he turned back into that scared farmboy. He’s whiny, and was reluctant to do even TRY to find the good in Ben.

Both when he was a Padawan and as a Sith apprentice, Luke didn’t even try. He found the good within his father, a full Sith Lord, yet Ben, a young padawan who he only saw a glimpse of fear within, was to far gone. It’s so uncharacteristic of him.

I know I just wrote an essay on Luke Skywalker and posted it on Reddit, but I just needed to vent. I don’t hate the sequels. Luke vs Kylo at the end of was great, and his talk with Yoda was also great, but I really wish Luke was just done a little bit better.

The second story revolves around a Jedi named Sora who has a similar backstory to Arc as his master was also killed in Order 66.

Straight googling it says “Ben did NOT kill lukes students, or burn down the temple! This is revealed in 'the rise of Kylo Ren' which IS canon!”

However the wiki for Destruction of Luke Skywalker’s Jedi academy says:
“Solo telekinetically collapsed his hut which trapped Skywalker under the debris, then he stood outside the temple before a lightning storm erupted and razed the structure. All of the students who were present died when Solo destroyed the temple.”

So my question is did Kylo kill Grogu???

Also I’m bad at research.

Now, just so I can say this before I get slaughtered, I have a few points to make.

- The prequel trilogy is also pretty much trash. The only thing it has going for it is better visuals and much better choreographed fight scenes.

- I grew up with the original trilogy, but barely, so they aren’t great memories from the 70’s that I associate with other awesome memories.

- Disney really makes almost everything excellently. It’s hard to argue with their success. Even people who have never watched Star Wars before watched this latest trilogy and really liked it. 


Now, let’s get to why the original trilogy is garbage:

- Acting: I know we all groan when little Anni shows his teenage angst on screen, but seriously, Luke, Obi-wan, and Darth Vader have some really poor acting in this movie. Even by standards of other classics from that era. The fights are terrible. Obi-wan and Vader’s fight makes it look like they’ve never held lightsabers until this battle. It’s atrocious compared to the other trilogies.

- Writing: the plot, the lines, the ideas... it just all kind of falls flat to me. There are holes in the continuation story that I just don’t like. (Obi-wan dying like a little bitch; Luke being the best pilot in the world; Like being able to speak to Obi-wan through the force despite having only experienced the force for like 10 seconds with a helmet on; etc.) at one point, Han says to Jabba, “You’re a wonderful human being.” It just seems weird when they are all in space and humans aren’t really that prevalent. Leía is bossy and Han is angry for almost no reason (they could be that way, but there is no moment of backstory given or thought shown as to why they would be that way. For being main characters, I would want a bit more development)

- Visuals: I know it’s old, but this makes it hard to watch for me. It looks like legos or stage props and CGI from a B-rated horror movie. The space scenes seem ancient. And the costumes look feel very 70’s space. The camera angles are weird. Like, a lot of the hallway scenes, the camera is stomach-high and off in a corner. 



Look, I know I’m being harsh. I know they had their place. I may not have even grown to like Star Wars had these movies not been filmed, but they are not the perfect works of art that people worship them as. And it seems like no other Star Wars movie or series can live up the the dull, poorly-written, visually weak films that Star Wars fans geek out over worldwide.

I really liked Rey and Kylo and their arcs to that point. And felt like the balance of hope vs despair was perfectly set for this to be a conclusion to the skywalker saga where the prophecy of restoring the balance tol the force finally came through.
Most likely in some sort of merging of light and dark.

But then 9 seemed to try it's best to wipe aside any of the through lines that 8 had placed into the narrative. And just wasn't the conclusion (or even wider universe set up) that I thought episode 8 was building towards.

Obviously what is cannon is now what is.
So I'm not wanting a retcon of the last abrams movie. But I would be so very interested to read/hear where Rian Johnson envisioned the saga going to form the launching point he set up.

However, after doing some thinking, I actually feel there is an unintentional and logical reason for this change.  Allow me to explain:

Within the span of 9 movies we see a drastic difference in fighting ability that ranges from fast and acrobatic (prequels), to slow and calculated (originals), to sloppy and amateur (sequels).  

While I believe that the choices for the combat and action is heavily determined by the filmmakers and the current technology/ training available.  I still feel an argument can be made that they all are consistent within the storyline of Star Wars itself.  

Currently, the earliest on screen representation of lightsaber combat is in the first 3 films (tPM, AotC, and RotS).  In these movie almost all Jedi and Sith are extremely talented in sword combat and use a variety of skills while fighting to create an almost artistic display of battle.  While many dislike this style, feeling it is too “over choreographed”, I think it fits well within the narrative of the films. The Jedi are coming out of their greatest period of strength and cultural prowess.  They have spent thousands of years training and mastering the force and lightsaber combat.  To me, it only makes sense that they would be extremely talented, and so in tune with the force because of their training by generations of Jedi. Hence their fighting techniques are astounding.  

I always liked the “over choreographed” duels because they reminded me that the Jedi and Sith have the ability to see in the very near future, almost like a Spidy-sense.  When very well trained, they can contemplate their opponents moves, making it a fight between wills and not just laser swords. 

Now imagine that all the knowledge and wisdom of the Jedi teachings suddenly disappeared, leaving only a few who remember it.  Enter order 66 and the Jedi purge (one of many throughout Star Wars lore).  The only Jedi left are slowly becoming old and out of practice with the force.  By the time we reach the original three films, Obi-Wan must teach a young adult Luke (Jedi usually start their training at a very young age) and dies before he has the chance to show him any real skills.  

Obi-Wan’s duel with Vader is the very first lightsaber battle created.  What it lacks in flamboyance and choreography, it makes up for in dialogue and high stakes.  Watching it now, it kind of just looks like two old men prodding each-other with glow sticks... but logically that is actually kind of true.  Obi-Wan is a lot older and technically isn’t trying to win, while Vader has always had a more rigged fighting style due to his loss of limbs.  Together they have a much more tame fight, because they aren’t trying to show off - they are having a conversation.

By the time Luke ends his training with Yoda, he is far more skilled, but still does not compare to the duelists of the past.  This is due in part to two factors: 1 - Luke started his training at a very old age. 2 - Luke only had a short time period to train at all.  In fact it’s a marvel that he is able to beat Vader at the end of the sixth film.  This just proves how powerful Luke was/is in the force. 

Now we come to the sequels. Believe me, I’m no fan of many of the choices they made for these movies, but I must acknowledge they all do have redeeming factors.  Something I used to hate, but now enjoy is the lightsaber duels between Kylo and Rey.  

In the Force Awakens, the fights between Kylo and Rey are so sloppy and seemingly un-choreographed that it made my stomach hurt.  It wasn’t until I realized that the both of them hardly received any training at all, that their fights made more sense.

You might be thinking to yourself, “but Kylo was trained by Luke at a young age! And also by Snoke, so therefore by Palpating himself!” And you wouldn’t be wrong.  But hear me out, it’s possible that Luke didn’t spend a whole lot of time teaching Ben Solo lightsaber combat, but perhaps more force abilities.  Remember, Luke himself didn’t receive much training until later in life either.  Perhaps he just hadn’t gotten to the point where Ben was ready for more difficult teachings.  I also highly doubt Snoke/Palpatine taught him anything in the way of dueling, as neither of them even used a lightsaber in the sequel trilogy.  

This leads me to my final conclusion.  As time progressed through the Skywalker Saga, we saw a massive loss in the teachings of lightsaber combat.  This left Luke, Rey and Kylo at an extreme disadvantage when it came to skillful fighting.  They just didn’t have the resources and trading available that the Jedi of the prequels did.  Therefore in the sequel films we see a much more amateur display, because they are in reality just that - amateurs.

It has also been described that the ancient Sith and Jedi were masters of lightsaber combat.  Hence my main quote.  This supports the idea that as time progressed, the Jedi and Sith slowly grew less powerful.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1729933,public,self,,,"“If you were to face an ancient Sith Lord in combat, you would learn that we are as children playing with toys compared to the prowess of the old masters.” - Kreia",0,[],0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/ktbcqx/if_you_were_to_face_an_ancient_sith_lord_in/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No apprentices, nothing. Just a light force user, and a dark force user. Sure that's not really balanced because palps is so powerful but still. The force was not only balanced, but anakin had (sorta) brought balance by wiping out every last jedi he could find. Now this only takes in account the movies, cause I know ashoka is still alive and a lot of other secret force users, but we're focusing on the jedi who normal people would view as near god like wizards.

As the title says, my fiancée is a little apprehensive about watching the Prequel Trilogy but she wants to watch The Clone Wars series with me when I rewatch and finally watch series 7. For some context, she's new-ish to the Star Wars fandom and gave the series a go because she is a bit of a closet geek who is opening up more and knows how fond of Star Wars I am.

She loved the original three films and Rogue One and enjoyed the Force Awakens and The Last Jedi to an extent, and hasn't watched Episode IX yet. She has been watching The Mandalorian with me and where I've been getting excited about character and item appearances and cameos in reference to extended canon, she wants to explore those series and watch them with me.

However, before watching any of the films, she was already aware of how bad a rep the Prequel films gets and she knows who Jar Jar Binks is and hates him, she knows all of the memes, all of the jokes, etc. and I think this further pushes her away from wanting to watch them. She has a rough idea of events of the prequel films from reading snippets about them but she doesn't want to spend 7, 8 hours watching them at the moment given the aforementioned stuff.

Any thoughts on this? Is it vital for her to watch the Prequel films before watching the Clone Wars series? Or if she enjoys the Clone Wars would it then be worth asking again about the prequel films?

I was introduced to Star Wars when the Force Awakens came out. I guess you could say the sequel trilogy was the one I grew up with. After watching TFA, I was intrigued. I went to buy the Blu-ray Complete Saga after that and binge watched it in days. And I loved it.  Yes, I did watched it in chronological order which is not recommended but it didn't matter.

So to get to the point, I love Star Wars because it gives me a sense of purpose in life, a sense of thrill, a looking forward attitude. And this may sound cliche but I really learned to differentiate right from wrong, and at that time I was a very rebellious person. After watching Star Wars, I had the desire to change my character. And Star Wars most importantly told me that I should not fear for the future, or be anxious about what's next, or to let me hatred and anger dissolve in me but to forgive others. This is really crucial for me and probably many other teenagers who's emotions may be clouded due to growing up.

And honestly the best part, is the music. John Williams, you're amazing.

I've finished TCW and The Mandalorian and am now halfway watching Rebels. I know many cannot come to accept this but I don't hate a trilogy. In fact, I love all the 9 movies.

A friend of mine kept pushing me to watch Star Wars, I used to dislike it and think it was boring childrens show (boy was I wrong!), now its probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite movie franchise/trilogy ever (Prequel fan here, big fan of OT too), am hooked now.

Saw all the movies, started TCW a few weeks ago I'm near the end of S2 rn, watched all of Mando, got plans to see Rebels after TCW ofc.

Much like the title says, I want an 18+, R rated SW show and I think Mando proved it can be done and it can be successful even though Mando is rated TV 14 its still got some fairly mature scenes (looking at you Boba).
But I would love if we got much more mature with it, I really want to see ""The true nature of the Dark side"", I wanna see something a bit different I guess. Many people claim violence, swearing and nudity is not needed and well, not really, SW is proof of that but it would be a treat, atleast for me, if we got much darker.

Maybe they can do a legends R rated show without messing w the continuity of canon SW.
Let me see Galen Malek rip people to shreds and destroy entire starships on screen, show me Vader slaughtering thousands of rebels after arguably his best line ever said ""All I am surrounded by is fear... and dead men""; I want to see true violence of the Dark Side thats always merely insinuated in the shows and movies. I am probably in the minority but I would really like it.

I actually really really really loved this movie!! Which surprised me because I did not really enjoy the force awakens. 

The number 1 reason I loved this film is why I’ve read many fans dislike it , the characterization and changes to luke. However , I feel luke contemplating killing Ben was actually in true Jedi form. From the prequels I always thought the Jedi were a bit self righteous , and I feel yoda and Samuel L Jackson had a great hand in creating Vader, by putting him down so often and making their distrust of him openly known, it had a lot of negative effects. So I was so happy to see this flaw in the Jedi be explored and have Luke, the last and ultimate Jedi, repeat that flaw and create Kylo Ren in a self fulfilling prophecy. The ghost of Yoda coming back and burning all the books and recognizing the need to move forward is one of my top favorite scenes so far. I also just love the visuals and think it’s a great self contained story. 

My problems with the film: I don’t like the addition of Laura Dern’s character, why replace Leia as the leader when you can just.... have Leia be in the film more? Maybe Carrie fisher didn’t want that much of a commitment but just wasn’t a fan of Leia being out of commission for so long. I also hated the character of Rose. Man that actress was bad, and I literally did not care about her dead sister at all like rebels are dying every second, it’s not impactful haha. I wish they would have put Billie Lourdes character in her place. And also wanted to see more Chewbacca.

Holy cow.

I knew I was missing out on some stuff, but I didnt realise how cool it was. I did not have TV services as a kid, all we had(and still have) is antennae, so I missed out on a lot of shows, including this one. The prequels and its stories were my first introduction to the Star Wars universe, so they have a special place in my heart, even with the bad writing. I had been meaning to get to the Clone Wars series for a while, since of course my Disney fanatic family had to get D+. And I finally finished all 7 seasons! While filler episodes felt easy to spot, I also just loved the whole thing. I was glued to my screen during those last few episodes. I absolutely loved learning about more lore that I hadn't heard about, the world, the stories. Seeing these awesome battles, hearing the banter. I absolutely LOVE Ahsoka. I cried several times for her because of how invested I was in her character and story, and her arc as she grew. And the pain. I knew that she was going to be kicked out of the Order, but I didn't realise it was happening right AT THAT TIME. And then she chose to walk away, which was painful but I agreed with it. And oh god, when the troopers put her face marking on their helmets. Fucking waterworks galore, that was so cool. I really want a trooper helmet with those decals now, that would be amazing. Made Order 66 even more painful .-.

I loved to see more of that young Anakin, even if I knew the horrors that were to come. I especially loved Obi-Wan, because hes just pretty cool. Cad Bane was cool, Hondo was funny. I laughed pretty hard at the episode where Hondo and Kenobi are discussing Savage and Maul. Speaking of Maul, hes pretty damn cool. I knew he was alive from Solo of course, and I had heard some things about his activities for Crimson Dawn, but it was cool to see his lead up to that point. And the creepy spider Maul was so uncomfortable, they did a wonderful job with that monstrosity.

And in knowing that you know nothing, that makes you the smartest of all."" - Socrates**

&amp;#x200B;

One reason Kanan &amp; Ezra are one of my all-time favorite teacher &amp; student relationships in *Star Wars* is specifically BECAUSE Kanan was himself still a student with limited experience upon meeting Ezra (much more so than Anakin, who was already a combat veteran, Republic General and Jedi Knight when he met Ahsoka). Even before his training was established as unfinished, I could tell from the first time I saw Kanan's youthful face that he was most likely a Padawan when Order 66 happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, even before he first ignited his lightsaber, I suspected his character would be revealed as a Jedi mainly because *Rebels* likely wouldn't have been as popular without at least one lightsaber wielding character. Granted, lightsabers certainly aren't inherently needed for *Star Wars* stories to be compelling but it is indisputable fact that the spectacle of this weapon is a major part of what made *Star Wars* iconic. Thus, a show that didn't include any saber wielders would be inherently more challenging to keep consistently entertaining in context of the show's target audience (children).

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Mutual Growth**

&amp;#x200B;

Back on topic, what I loved most about both Kanan &amp; Ezra's arcs is how they help each other grow. While Kanan was against the Empire, he initially wasn't in favor of fighting a war against them after he'd already been traumatized by the loss of his master and comrades at the Clone War's unfortunate climax. Despite his physical age as a young adult, he was still truthfully a child at heart in this aspect (meaning, he'd long suppressed the part of him that still felt like that young, scarred Padawan).

&amp;#x200B;

In this sense, one could compare him to Finn who was similarly against the First Order and willing to help his friends survive against them. Yet, it wasn't until *TLJ*'s 3rd act that he fully committed to the Resistance. Instead of a character whose goals at least partially aligned with the Rebels, he became a loyal Rebel himself willing to risk his life for something greater than himself or those he personally cared about. The Kanan we see in Season 1 is a freedom fighter, but not yet truly a loyal Rebel.

&amp;#x200B;

It's partially if not largely his relationship with Ezra that gives him enough hope for the future that he cements his motivation to join the war against the Empire as a whole, instead of just fighting smaller forces during missions on Imperial-occupied worlds. This conflict also feeds into his motive to train Ezra, which pushes Kanan to eventually embrace the Jedi within himself that he'd previously only ever tapped into for purposes of combat &amp; survival. By the same token, Ezra grows from this in how he starts as a mischievous child fighting a corrupt authority and comes to believe in selflessly helping others. By extension, he too becomes invested in the Jedi way despite his brushes with the Dark Side.

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Learning The Difference Between Guidance vs Control**

&amp;#x200B;

Over time, we see Kanan struggle between the boundaries of a teacher guiding Ezra based on what little he learned vs. an older brother figure who can be overprotective and at times controlling over Ezra. These two roles clash because Kanan projects his anguish (perhaps sometimes unconsciously) over what he's lost onto his apprentice, thereby unintentionally hindering Ezra's growth at points. He's so driven to keep Ezra safe and on the right path despite being unsure himself at times over what the *""right""* path is. Had this continued, it could have become a *""blind leading the blind""* dynamic.

&amp;#x200B;

By struggling to let Ezra fail, let him learn on his own and ultimately let him go, Kanan not only held his student back but by also himself (This is similar to Anakin's struggle to let go of Ahsoka in *The Clone Wars*). By finally realizing that he can't dictate Ezra's path, Kanan simultaneously frees himself from this growing overprotective need for control (This could have possibly transitioned into a desire for dominance) and matures into a full fledged Jedi. Obviously, this is where Kanan's arc arguably peaks.

&amp;#x200B;

While he does continue to grow after losing his sight, his mentorship over Ezra could be debated to have largely reached its limit by Seasons 3-4. This is where he becomes the best version of himself in my opinion, as his blindness can be interpreted as a metaphor for letting go of everything he knew prior. I don't refer so much to Obi-Wan's famous line *""Your eyes can deceive you, don't trust them.""*

&amp;#x200B;

It's more that I interpret his blindness as a *""rebirth""* of sorts, starting over not just to relearn how to fight but to unlearn what he's learned (not literally, but symbolically) in order to gain true wisdom. When Kanan finally regains his sight in the moment before sacrificing himself, I believe this could be interpreted as Kanan's eyes having been opened for the first time. It can represent how he's become *""whole""* as a Jedi, a Rebel, and a person in general. Not to mention, how he's helped Ezra grow too.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Wisdom In Accepting Limitations**

&amp;#x200B;

*""Zero Hour""* brilliantly builds up to this during one of Kanan &amp; Ezra's last dialogues: Kanan- *""At times, I was afraid, afraid that I couldn't teach you everything you needed to know.""* Ezra- *""But you did. I've learned so much.""* Kanan- *""And so have I. We all have. In fact, sometimes I wonder if I have anything left to teach you.""* Ezra- *""No, that can’t be true.""* Kanan- *""My own Jedi training was limited.""* Ezra- *""I don’t mean about the Force. I mean about life, about being a good person. That’s what you taught me.""*

&amp;#x200B;

There's a poetry here that makes Kanan's death that much more impacting, like a *""Twas blind, but now I see""* moment (in more ways than one). While Ezra still has a long way to go before reaching the same point as his teacher, Kanan's sacrifice feels partially like him consciously acknowledging that he's no longer needed. He's not happy about dying, but no longer fears it either, nor does he fear losing his family. I believe he probably sensed in this moment that everything will be all right in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

He successfully healed the wounds that had held him back for so long, overcoming his fear &amp; trauma. To paraphrase Cal Kestis, the loss had become a part of him as opposed to an obstacle. *""Whatever is in the way BECOMES the way.""* Kanan did his part in the war and helped cultivate hope for what comes after. He did his part for Ezra and realizes it's time for him to continue his journey without him. Thus, he detaches himself and lets go. This moment defines what I'd consider to be a VERY wise Jedi, especially for Kanan's age, because he recognizes that he's fulfilled his role in the eyes of the Force.

Hardly a spoiler here, but tagged just in case. I just started Light of the Jedi, and I noticed an interesting distinction of eras in the first chapter. The author is describing the ship that is currently being flown, and notes how it is “certainly not one of those New Republic Long Beams.” Interesting that, although this Era is the “High Republic” era, he refers to one of the, what I assume to be a modern, ships as a “New Republic” ship. 

I only took notice to this because if the High Republic era is considered to also be a “New Republic,” that must mean that there is an a Old Republic for this one to come out of. Theoretically, there can be infinite “Old Republics” but the Star Wars fan in me wonders if this is a set up to an even older era? Idk, I’m think about maybe some Knights... and the Old Republic of which they served??

The knights look very impressive, they have a mystique, are clearly somewhat Force Sensitive and are a defining aspect of Bens turn into Kylo. 

However we never really got to see them in action too much or get the gist that these people were closely tied to Kylo, that there was actual loyalty and bonds there.

I think a movie or more likely mini series seeing them in action (possibly shortly after Kylo first takes command of them, or just before TFA) would help in this aspect develop a lot

Realistically we also wouldn’t see Kylo without his mask so you could do other without Adam Driver if he didn’t have time/want to come back for it.

Books like “Lords of the Sith”, “The Rise of Lord Vader”, and “Darth Plagius” all gave us interested perspectives on the bad guys and further developed them well. I think the knights and kylo would do well with this too but the shows give us a chance to see this in live action.

It still is, except as a kid I didn't knew that I unconsciously resonated with its themes as much as the spectacles. But.. nothing compares with the emotion after the first view. 

Popular opinion, but I did not liked the newest trilogy, but also respect the people who do, besides each person resonates with the movies differently, but I didn't find themes at all on the new ones; and that's what I like about this franchise.

With Rebels and the newest trilogy I said to myself I wasn't going to like Clone Wars.

The themes of Jedi being also wrong, and showing that clones have humanity as well, with further world building, bunch of story arcs and cast of characters was amazing. Ahsoka Tano and Anakin relationship was so good, I felt emotional the same way about these two like I did with Geralt of Rivia and Ciri from The Witcher 3. And those last 4 episodes of Clone Wars were peak Star Wars in recent history. I absolutely loved all the characters, Maul, Jesse, Rex, Ahsoka, Fives, Echo, and the rest I didn't mentioned. Maul's speech when trying to team up with Ahsoka to kill the emperor in Mandalore was phenomenal. Rex crying for his brothers beneath his helmet in front of Ahsoka while chipped Jesse and the rest of the clones are standing, waiting for orders to kill was heartbreaking. Maul captured in the skies of Mandalore screaming ""Death is coming!"" was so eerie because of what he saw in his visions. Ahsoka return to the republic and all the clones saluting to her while saying commander was so satisfying, but also sad. The burying of the clones with the music playing while showing Jesse's helmet and the rest was very emotional. And of course the final scene with a painted clone helmet resembling Ahsoka while Vader moving away from the helm's reflection was a perfect way to end the series.

While I watched Mandalorian Season 2, Ahsoka again in live action was great to see, especially because I thought Rosario Dawson imitated her very well, the movements and voice were actually on point. And also seeing Bo Katan after Clone Wars in live action was awesome as well, I think we'll get more of her on season 3, gonna be interesting to see how Mando deals with the Darksaber with Bo Katan.

Luke Skywalker and Han Solo save the day, rescue the Princess, and humiliate the Empire. Then in Empire Strikes Back, all of the heroes are forced to face the consequences of their heroism. 

 While Han and Leia are being hunted down by Vader, Luke has to decide on whether to complete his Jedi training with Yoda, or submit to Vader's trap by trying to save his friends in Cloud City. 

The movie ends with Luke making the decision to save his friends, and this comes at a price as was foreshadowed by Yoda. Vader tries to turn Luke to the dark side but is too aggressive and chops his off his arm and ends up driving Luke to attempted suicide. Meanwhile Han and Leia's arc is complete with Han's iconic good bye and Han goes down as a rebel hero. 

The ending of Empire isn't really a cliff hanger, it is actually a resolution to the story. Luke, Vader, Han, and Leia all have complete character arcs after this movie. The heroes made a great achievement in destroying the Death Star, but as is the case with war, they all to pay a huge price for it as Vader and the Empire get their revenge.

Everything that follows afterwards in the franchise is not only unnecessary to the story, but also not very good.

Other people have had this idea but I want to give my take on it. I think that a Sequels show like The Clone Wars focused on The New Republic and Luke's Jedi Academy could be extremely beneficial to add depth to the universe. I think that it would add depth to a lot of the characters. To those who don't like the sequels like myself, and those who already like them, I believe that this could be a great benefit to both sides and could appeal to both. Here are some of the broad things that the plot could focus on:

* Forming and disfunction of The New Republic
   * Make the audience care about the characters
* Rise of the First Order
* Again, give the audience more of a reason to care about the destruction of Ben Solo
   * The subsequent birth of Kylo Ren and giving depth to his fellow Padawans who he murdered (I know this was in a comic but a show would reach a lot more people I feel)
* Give more depth and reason for Luke's fall
* Maybe show some children being abducted to become Stormtroopers?

I think that this would be really great and I would love to see something like this. If done correctly, I think that something like this could really help to unite the fans.

The same characters, doing about the same things, just a bit older, having MAJOR call backs to the original movies, flashbacks even, and introducing every character there ever was once again and having plot points built around them.  And even having recycled dialogue.

Cobra Kai is A LOT OF FUN. Its a great way to look back at things we loved in the 1980s, and I was just wondering if this is what people wanted for the ST?

If so, why???? This so is so cheesy. Its good, its a fun guilty pleasure watch, but holy cow is it so bad. Yes its great to see the old characters doing the same things, just older, but why would you want this kind of fan service for Star Wars?

I can just hear it now.  Old Luke turning to Old Han saying ""huh.....and i thought they smelt bad on the outside"" to some random monster they just beat. They share a look and run off to save Leia from IG-88 or something.

I much prefer the ST and its attempt, not the best attempt, at telling a new story and using the OT characters in a more of a supporting role to guide the new characters. (and yes we know TFA is ANH in new clothing sometimes, but thats ok, the main plot of the ST was different).

Also, this is a very long post of me just writing down how I think and feel personally. I am not forcing you to read or comment.\*\***

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a huge Star Wars fan since the 90s. I love the original trilogy, I love the prequels despite their flaws, I love Rogue One, I've learned to love Solo, I love the Clone Wars show, I love the Rebels show, and I love the Mandalorian show.

&amp;#x200B;

But being a homosexual guy, I feel weirdly excluded from Star Wars despite these movies and shows combined literally have hundreds of characters. You'd think by this point, there would be at least ONE openly gay male character, right?

&amp;#x200B;

And please don't give me the ""sexuality was never important to Star Wars"" fallacy. Heterosexual romance is EVERYWHERE in Star Wars. Leia and Han, Anakin and Padme, Obi-Wan and Satine, Ahsoka and Lux, Lux and Steela, Aurra Sing and Hondo, Kanan and Hera... do you want me to keep going? Or, have I made my point yet? And please don't mention C-3P0 and R2-D2 as an example of a ""gay couple"". If it's a joke, it's not funny to me. And if you suggest it seriously? Both are sexless droids, and it's never confirmed they have any actual romantic attraction to each other.

&amp;#x200B;

The closest I can think of is Baze and Chirrut from Rogue One, but it is only vaguely implied at best. And I know for a fact that a lot of fans AND the actors of Poe and Finn in the sequel trilogy wanted those two to be an openly gay couple (Finn would of course be bisexual in that case, but still), but that never happened, and it seemed like Disney tried to do everything they could to make sure that did NOT happen.

&amp;#x200B;

And no, it doesn't count if there are any characters that are only so-called ""confirmed by the creators"" to be gay. Unless it's actually shown in the actual work, it doesn't count to me. People in all of the movies and shows seem to be open about their heterosexuality one way or another all the time, even if it's just a matter of being flirty or what-have-you.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not expect every single thing ever to have gay inclusion. But when NONE of the movies or shows have any gay male inclusion in them? For me as a huge Star Wars fan who happens to be gay, it really hurts.",True,False,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,1727793,public,self,,,Personal thoughts on lack of gay inclusion in Star Wars,0,[],0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/kshgqb/personal_thoughts_on_lack_of_gay_inclusion_in/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Watched it tonight. I have questions. Some things still confuse me.

\- Dooku. He tells Obi Wan the Senate is controlled by the Sith. Same person is his master. So....Dooku is leading a seperatist movement which is opposed to the Senate/Republic...while serving a guy who is the literal head of the Senate/Republic. So why tell Obi Wan? Does Dooku actually have aspirations of his own outside of Palpatine? What is his motivation? Dooku is pitched as a fallen good guy doing something because he thinks the Senate/Republic is corrupt...but is following orders from the guy at the head of that corruption. I don't...

\- Threepio. First of all, the fact he was on the Lars farm and went with Shmi. So this means Owen and Beru had Threepio for years and...what? Forgot they used to have him? Second, why does he go with Anakin and Padme? It really feels like there was a cut scene where there was an explanation. It wouldn't have even been hard....Anakin made him, Threepio is the only thing he has left of his mother etc...any excuse would have been fine, but there's just nothing.

Other thoughts I had, as general observations:

\-  I....I actually kinda liked Hayden's acting. It isn't the acting that's the problem. It's the writing. He does the bes he can with it. It's certainly very cheesy at times, but I can rationalise that as Anakin being so out of touch with his emotions, thank to the Jedi. He's poor at expressnig himself. So he flies into fits of rage. That makes sense to me. 

\- Of everyone, I have to say it's actually Natalie Portman's acting that brings things down. 

\- Ewan is Space Jesus. 

\- Ian McDiarmid is great.

\- Mace Windu's lightsaber technique is so unique to everyone else. Everyone is all rapid deflects and fast movement. He looks like he's swimming. I kinda like it, but it doesn't seem to fit well within the idea that his combat style is actually channeling the dark side and more aggressive, which it really doesn't look to me. If anything it's almost the opposite, very zen and calm.

Hi guys and gals.

I waited patiently so I could binge watch The Mandalorian S1-S2 in one sitting. I started liking this show a lot early on and since I'm autistic thus I get often obsessed with things I grow fond of. I wanted to make the concept art of each episode as slideshow wallpaper but I couldn't find them in high enough quality. The highest, most crisp and quality arts were found on either the [official twitter page](https://twitter.com/themandalorian/status/1196953065934348289?lang=en) of Star Wars or the official Star Wars site. So, here's what I did:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\*Downloaded each episode's concept art from the [official site](https://www.starwars.com/)  
&gt;  
&gt;\*Quite a lot of images were in the more modern [.webp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP) format so I had to convert them to more popular [.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) format to be able to edit them effectively  
&gt;  
&gt;\*Used [paint.net app](https://www.getpaint.net/) and [Topaz Gigapixel AI](https://topazlabs.com/gigapixel-ai/) 5.3.2 app to clean, de-noise and upscale the concept arts \*Saved the images in .jpg/jpeg format

&amp;#x200B;

This way the file size of the 157 found arts (sadly expectedly) increased from 40 mb to 440 MB.

I don't know if someone else had done this already but I hope at least some of you will make use of these images as I did.

You can check out and download the arts here:

Any time his feelings were getting in the way of his duties and/or he sought counsel from Yoda, all he was ever told from the age of nine was to “be mindful” of his feelings and push them down so he could keep his focus on the moment and avoid the dark side. If he had just had a therapist who he could confidentially work through his emotions with, it would have been less likely that he turn to the dark side.

As for the Jedi Code’s celibacy (another point of conflict for Anakin), look at real life religions whose clergy swear oaths of celibacy. Most denominations of Christianity preach introspection and especially seeking emotional and/or spiritual help when it is needed. Hell, one of the holy sacraments is confession, where as far as I’ve gleaned from media (I haven’t ever done it myself), people repent for their sins while a priest guides and consoles them.

Well now any time I talk to anyone about Star Wars, they absolutely love the prequels, almost as much as the originals. Now they’ve moved their disdain to the sequel trilogy. All I hear is how it’s just a rehash, how Palpatine came out of nowhere, how they didn’t flesh out every character ever introduced, etc etc.

Everyone gets way too worked up to enjoy these movies when they come out by analyzing every frame in every movie, and nobody can step back and just enjoy them. Of course, give it 10 years and everyone will love the whole Skywalker saga and pretend they didn’t complain about these nitpicky things.

You can go take a look for yourself, but there's ample evidence of this.

The thing is, *some* things are put there. For example, in Ventress' Databank page, the stuff that happens in Dark Disciple is there. With Tarkin, however, the stuff that happens in Star Wars: Tarkin doesn't seem to be there.

This is confusing me a lot, and the fact that the films and shows are the only things put in the ""Appearances"" tab is even more confusing.

So overall I think is like this:

Force powers: Luke &gt; Ahsoka &gt; Ezra.

Lightsaber skills: Ahsoka &gt; Luke = Ezra.

I still think that overall Ezra is the weaker of the three but not because he is a weak Force-user himself, I just think that he is the average while Ahsoka is very talented and have a lot of experience and Luke have greatest potential than both but lack Ahsoka's experience.

Ahsoka, Grogu, Leia, Luke, and maybe Ezra being separated might be one way they could remain undetected.

Before I start I just want to say I don't hate the mandalorian in any way and I'm genuinely glad that it seems to have united the community but I think it has some serious flaws that I haven't really seen addressed anywhere and I want to understand if people agree with me and like the mandalorian despite its flaws or if they are all subjective and the series just wasn't for me.

I'll start with some praise, the art design and general look of both series is perfect. The character design, settings and ships are amazing and it is obvious that great care (and expense) was taken in making the series visually fit in to the star wars universe.

...........

My biggest single issue with the entire show is the music. I think the music generally sounds good but it doesn't really feel connected to the rest of star wars and I found it distracting in many scenes. I'm not asking for everything star wars to have a Williams-esque classical orchestral score and it was a good choice to try going a new direction with the music but it feels as though they threw out everything that had been developed in the universe's scores and started from scratch. Star wars has almost always had very melodic scores on orchestral instruments and has always used this style with mandalorians in clone wars and rebels (although I may be missing context as I have only binge watched youtube clips and only recently started watching the full series in order) however the mandalorian went with a mostly rhythmic score with prominent usage of synthetic instruments and scrapped any musical development from other media so it could start fresh. I think such a radical change really prevented the series from feeling as though it is a part of the star wars universe and it would have been better to adapt the previous styles with new elements rather than a completely fresh style. There were many moments I really enjoyed, especially when they pulled the brass section out for a toot toot.

Personally I was hoping for something that would take some influence from the republic commando game which has music written in the mandalorian language but I'll just have to keep dreaming about more commando media.

.........

Next I think the characters weren't very well done. None of characters really grow, the most significant growth being the mando learning that its ok for people to see his face (kind of) after 2 series. There doesn't need to be character growth if the writers would prefer a style where they are witness' to interesting plots and stories however the plots are generally very cliche and the twists are pretty easy to see coming in my opinion.

They make very odd decisions that seem to be based on plot convenience instead of their motivations, most blatantly at the end of series 1 when Gideon is trying to capture Grogu and likely kill the main crew. To his knowledge Grogu has already been captured by the speeder bike troops, the crew are surrounded in a bar with no escape and he has a weapon that could kill them at any time. Instead of just killing them he gives them until nightfall to come out and ""cooperate"" while executing his own troops according to the dialogue. Unless I missed something the only reason for him to do this is to give the crew time to escape. There are plenty of moments like this throughout the series and it completely kills tension and interest for me as you know the characters don't have to come up with interesting or creative solutions to problems and instead just wait for the writer to bail them out. 

This point is definitely subjective but the dialogue is just bad, none of the characters feel like real people. Everyone is either giving an over dramatic one liner or just giving some exposition for the plot. The imperials especially feel like they've walked out of some pantomime, everything line of dialogue they say feels like it should end with a mustache twirl and maniacal laugh. They are purely motivated by being evil with the exception of the client from season 1 who has a slight bit of development before Gideon guns him down to prove how evil he is.

My bad season 3 prediction is that Gideon is a new republic spy which explains why he spends most of his time killing imperial troops, sending them on obvious suicide missions or just straight up ordering them to kill themselves.

.........

Finally just a couple of minor gripes I have with it all:

\- The series does a poor job of showing the scale of the empire; it could be a small well equipped cult or a major power rivaling the new republic based on what we see. We don't know if Gideon's faction is the entire remnant of the empire or just a part of it. Of course the series doesn't need to answer every question but it would really help with world building and tension if we had a sense of what the mando is actually up against. (Also I assume these questions have been answered in books/comics but I believe a series like this should be able to develop/show the world without the need for background reading).

\- The armour is inconsistent, sometimes he can take the fire of entire squads, sometimes he is injured by a single shot. Sometimes he is willing to walk out in front of dozens of stormtroopers and sometimes he's taking cover from a couple. It kills tension when you have no idea if he is actually in danger or his armour is impervious to the enemies weapons.

.........

I honestly don't like to put so much effort into something negative but I haven't really seen these points brought up anywhere and I honestly am having trouble understanding the amount of praise for the series so I'm curious what people who enjoyed it think in response and hoping people will have seen positives that I didn't. I suspect the answer is going to end up being that others simply don't see these as problems and enjoy these things which is a bit underwhelming but perfectly fine. Star wars is big enough to have multiple types of media that won't be for everyone so I'm glad you lot enjoyed this and hopefully there'll be something along I can enjoy as well soon.

I thought this movie was.... okay 

What I love: Finn, Poe, BB8 , and of course Chewbacca. The first act of the film was amazing and I love how it introduced us to all the new characters. It also felt like a marvel movie and I’m a huge Disney-marvel fan so that’s a plus for me , I know some fans disagree. 

Then once Han Solo came back things got.... murky. First of all it’s soooo silly to have Han leave Leia and HIS SON behind when the first order is rising to power like the original trilogy showed he didn’t even leave when he had very little to do with the rebels, yet now that he has a literal family involved he goes back to being on the run? Completely out of character. The entire middle section particularly with Lupita’s character I would have liked to be replaced with more explanation of Kylo’s back story and what leia and Han have been up to and how this happened. 

Also Luke just abandoning leia too?? Like alrightyyyy then?! And speaking of Leia Carrie fishers delivery just seemed... off. I hate to say that as I adore Carrie fisher as a celebrity but I partly blame the writing as all her lines were just shallow and vague. Like “yeah we had some good times!!” To han like WTF your son is evil and you are back right where you started. 

Also Rey suddenly understanding the force so well after the idea of being a Jedi was written as so sacred in episodes 1-6. But I’ll forgive that cause there has to be a new hero and Luke picked up on everything pretty quickly in the originals as well.

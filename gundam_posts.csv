Last year I started by watching the 0079 recap trilogy and a couple of months ago I finished Zeta, I'm so excited about this franchise! Now I'm looking forward to see ZZ and Char's Counterattack and several others. I also watched the two Gundam Thunderbolt movies as the trailers looked sick and I was told that I didn't necessarily need to finish the UC to understand them and I had a blast with the first one, it's so damn good. I was somewhat disappointed with the second one as I didn't realize it was starting a bigger story and wasn't going to be a self-contained movie like the first one until the very end.

I planned it for about a month, so I used Toru Furuya as my subject of presentation. On the day of the presentation, my classmates aren't prepared for it, so I volunteered myself.

The first part of the presentation was describing Toru Furuya's background and even his background. After that, I moved on to his list of popular roles: as far as I can remember, I listed his very first role in the voice acting, followed by Amuro Ray (of course, its an obligation), Yamcha, Tuxedo Mask and as I was about to introduce Ribbons Almark, I faked getting a stomach-ache in the middle of the presentation. The teacher excused me but as I get out of the classroom, I returned wearing a pair of sunglasses. They simply ignored that part, so I continued the slide as if nothing happened, but here's the real kicker:

&amp;#x200B;

* Me: Let's continue. This is Ribbons Almark from Mobile Suit Gundam 00. He's unique in that Furuya was popular as Amuro Ray and Ribbons could potentially sway the popularity from the show's real protagonist. To solve this, Furuya disguises himself as.... (*in deeper voice*) Noboru Sogetsu.

&amp;#x200B;

And I showed them Noboru Sogetsu's photo, the entire classroom burst into laughter, finally getting why I put the sunglasses. It was the first time since elementary that I feel like a winner in the English class.

While I thought it was pretty great overall, there's one deus ex machina that bothered me about it. Namely Bernie's Zaku Kai. In one of the opening missions, a Zeon squad attcks the colony to gain intel on suspected Federatiom activity, including the possibility of the Gundam Alex, and Bernie is shot down, and crash lands in a public park. He strips it of weapons and such when he evacs, but doesn't scuttle it or make any real efforts to hide it. It then basically sits there for the rest of the series, undisturbed aside from Al messing around with it, until it suddenly becomes essential to the plot, so Bernie can use it to try to takedown the Gundam and save the colony. During this period the colony was attacked once, infiltrated, and attacked again, all without the Riah Republic government succeeding in locating it, even though doing so would be critical for public saftey. They must not even have looked for it very hard, considering it's not well camouflaged. It's actually amazing nobody randomly stumbled upon it, even. Also, at the end, you see Al's friends manage to steal a bunch of spent MS weapon shells and stuff from the school ruins, because the site isn't properly secured during cleanup. They could have just as easily taken UXO. That's all pretty crazy, and really made things a little too convenient, considering all the intricate subterfuge employed for everything else. It's a weak point in the writing. Another thing is that I noticed there were no Brightslaps, but I was on edge the entire time, because I thought there would be! There's one incidence of a falcon punch, but no slaps. There's so much slapping in early UC it caught me off guard. I thought for sure Al was going to get slapped by the Federation soldiers when he smashed up their Jeep, but nope! Ordinarily, I would have enjoyed the omission of an element of senseless violence, but it just disrupted my focus a little, because I was bracing myself for it to happen. Also, I really wonder what Zeon ace was piloting that red Gelgoog that Gundam Alex destroyed? Anyway, everything else was pretty great, and I really enjoyed it.

I watched the dubs and do not know the japanese version of each phrase I'm about to explain, so if anyone does please speak up. Note - Original Ocean dub (not redub)  


I noticed two reoccurring lines of dialogue spoken by numerous characters across each franchise.  In Gundam Seed, it is common to hear the phrase ""It couldn't be helped.""  This line consistently accompanies an explanation of an action with tragic consequences.  Cagali, Kira, and Athrun all speak the line at various points regarding each other.  This climaxes in the lines usage surrounding the final duel of Kira and Athrun, wherein Athrun self-destructs and believes he killed Kira.  He uses it while explaining why Kira had to die to Cagali.  She uses it against him later on.  


Kira uses the line several times.  The most poignant use of the line, however, comes from its sole use by Lacus Clyne.  ""But it couldn't be helped, now could it?  Because that's war, and you both were fighting against the enemy.  Am I mistaken?""  In this instance, Lacus uses the line mockingly, so as to reject it.  It *can* be helped.  It *must* be helped.  War is awful and terrible and it shouldn't be excused nor used as one.    


The line ""It Couldn't be Helped"" rests at the core of the philosophy that of the conflict.  It's inevitable.  The sides cannot agree, they are enemies, they *must* fight.  Lacus rejects this conceit, resulting in the creation of a faction that sides with neither ""enemy side"" and pushes for peace and mutual cooperation and prosperity.  The line exists to sum up the false root of the conflict, so that it may be refuted.  So it seems to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Unicorn offers a different line.  ""Even so.""  Each time, the line is spoken of regarding some pain, some conflict, some inevitable negative.  It even makes a final appearance in Gundam Narrative, &gt;!with Banagher speaking to Jora at the end, offering him the belief he cannot simply quit!&lt;. ""Even so, \[we must press on\].""  This, or something similar, is the sentiment being expressed.  You might also hear ""Inspite of it all-"" which carries the same sentiment.  Characters in Unicorn who embrace this idea, this philosophy, press on.  They keep going, believing a brighter future still exists, still trying to find a future, a reason to live.    


There probably isn't an intentional resonance to these lines, or maybe dissonance is the right term?  I just noticed the contrast while rewatching both series, and I wanted to talk about it.  Seed is a dark, awful, horrible conflict.  It's filled with pain and savagery, with people betraying themselves and their morals or ideals or friendships.  ""It couldn't be helped.""  The defeated conceit that it was inevitable.  Thankfully, the ultimate purpose of this line is to defeat this line, to cast it as shame, as wrong.  Seed builds the narrative of inevitability, then rejects it.  Unicorn, instead, builds the narrative of ""Possibility"" with ""Even So.""  Press on, believing something is possible, a better future still exists.

We here at the Federation and the SFF have noticed that after our troops stopped the six attempt by a space based faction to commit genocide many of you still have criticisms at our rules and method.

We have heard your claims of our leadership being corrupt, putting the interests of the wealthy first and using fascist tactics against political opponents but however that could not be farther from the truth. We have never had a leader who openly compared themselves to Hitler, we never tried to create a state mandated religion that worshiped space nor have we ever tried to use a large flying rock/metal/religiously named super weapon to ""force humanity to evolve""/""stop our souls from being held down by gravity""/make statement on wealth inequality unlike our political competitors. 

We are often criticized for not giving the Earth ""time to heal"" its resources but we at the federation understand that people like living on Earth and being a democracy we can't just go around forcing people to do what they don't want too like some Zeon worshiping nimrod in the name of an ever changing ""greater good"". We at the Federation understand that understand resources are limited we are resolute in our in attempts to solve the problem without forcing our citizens to live in huts/ machine gunning random people to keep the population down/ creating some type of Logan's Run cannibal system that was not very well thought out.

We however will admit to our failings with the Titians and selling of a large space rock one Char Aznable. We are show great regret that our reaction to a war that RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF HALF OF OUR POPULATION AND THE ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION OF THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET OUR POLITICAL OPPOSITION CLAIM TO WANT TO PROTECT was both too military focused and oppressive while also being too bureaucratic and business like. In the future, we at the Federation plan to come up with more respectively and peacefully reacting to the attempted genocide our citizens.

Now we of the SFF must ask you, the viewer, some questions. Are high luxury good prices worth siding with a family who spend their giving each other awards and government positions? Do wealthy corporations finding ways to avoiding paying taxes really lead you into the arms of a man who wear his sun glasses indoors and wants to make an entire planet uninhabitable to ""make a point""? Does our negative reaction to ""Space primal anarchism sci-fi Buddhism evolution"" really justify super weapon production and and science experiments on strange autistic teenagers?

We at the SFF believe the answers to those questions are no and if you agree with any of the above statements we also believe that says more about you than it does about the Federation's ability to lead

So the next time you see the Federation being cursed in a online post for being ""Bureaucratic"", ""Neo-liberal"" or ""Fascist"" remember one thing, at the end of the Federation is G-Saviour. Is that really what you want?

But then there was the novel Hathaway's Flash, which follows the events of Beltorchika's Children.

Prior to the announcement of the movie/OVA of *Hathaway's Flash*, I was under the impression that the original story, penned by Tomino and called ""Hathaway's Flash"", along with ""Beltochika's Children"", was similar to Tomino's novelisation of the original *Mobile Suit Gundam* (the one where Amuro dies and Char takes over as the Gundam's pilot), in that it's an alternate version of events that doesn't tie in to the animated canon.

So what that'd mean is that if the movie/OVA follows the original story, it *won't* sync-up with the events of *Char's Counter-Attack*, because they tell an alternate version of events.

Like here are some examples:

Unicorn Gundam: Believes himself to be ""bold and pure"" like the unicorn, and strickly holds himself to that standard. Yet is conflicted because he's slightly awkward and goes into an almost uncontrolled rage when encountering a new type. 

He can be really emotional, just not around the professionals for the sake of his humility, and often fervently talk about his feelings to someone he feels close to or he know's will understand. Tries to find hobbies as a form of copping under the stress. He has a heart of gold and knows when to hold his tongue, though will slip up from time to time. The white devil is a nickname that really gets to him.

He does not align himself to any side and the fighting style mostly involves disorienting and disarming his foes until retreat.  He will never truly go in for the kill unless absolutely necessary like the defense of others or himself. Unicorn goes above and beyond to maintain this and restrains himself as much as possible in fear of killing when he could have offered mercy. Big nope on fighting as a whole.

Barbatos Gundam: Short-tempered, brash, arrogant, and a real smart ass. He's headstrong and doesn't back down from a challenge no matter what condition he's in often pushing himself too far and ignoring his limits. His moral compass is quite fickle and he has a dark sense of humor.

This guy's not the type to were his heart on his leave, burying his emotions, and doesn't really know how to deal with them. His voice get's really high when he's about to cry and his hands shake, so he doesn't trust himself to speak and put's them behind his back. He's quite lonely but pretends that he wants it this way. Most other Gundam frames see him as the enemy, want nothing to do with him, or he just plain doesn't connect with them.

He is the last guy you want to piss off, offering no mercy when fighting. Striking hard and fast you be lucky to survive 10 minutes. His main reasons for fighting are being provoked, such as ambush and assault. There is no hesitation to kill and will if he gets the chance. He's really vicious and has no qualms about playing dirty. Barbatos is no stranger to revenge. He deals with internal conflict and wonders if he really enjoys killing others.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,95735,public,self,,,If Gundams were alive and sentient.

The time travel is a metaphor for sure, but that is only on a thematic level, on a literal level there was actual time travel.... however maybe not in the way that we may have originally thought.


The only thing that was actually traveling through time was not the gundam, zeong, and their pilots, but the pilots alone, or rather their consciousnesses. It was only Banagher’s and Full Frontal’s minds that went to the past and future to see things that had been and will be, their physical forms stayed tight where they were.

So this will be a somewhat inbetween a review and a reflection of each series. I'll be focusing on content on the series rather than any associated products that came out of the series. I've also decided to focus on the Gundam Anime that are full series and not OVA's or one off movies (ie 00 Movie will be included with 00 rating). I've also decided to split this between Gundam and Gunpla which I will explain why when I get to talking about the Gunpla series. I'll also do my best to avoid spoilers in my main post but comments and the like will have free reign. Note (I'm not sure why I have to say this but lately I feel like this has to be said): Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and thoughts, don't shoot some nameless pilot down just because you think you are right and they are wrong (ie be respectful to each other and have some fun). 

1) First Pick: Gundam 00 + Gundam 00 Movie:

When I first saw the announcement of Gundam 00, I was about to start my freshman year of high school. This was the third major Gundam anime I had watched since discovering mecha. I was initially worried that it would mirror Gundam Wing too much but between the first 10 episodes all those worries had washed away. The world building and music selection for the show was brilliant and well crafted. I didn't find anything super outrageous with the plot and the series stayed true to its original intent. To anyone new to Gundam I would hands down recommend this series especially if you don't want to watch something with outdated visual animation. This was also the first Gundam series to split itself into two separate seasons which worked out very well given how they handled everything. My one complaint really is that the end of the first season felt rushed in part because they were setting up everything coming in season 2 and this again was the first time they had split a series in half like this. The movie also didn't upset anything that had been done in the main series nor did it contradict the main series itself. The story of the movie also flowed in fairly seemlessly and stayed true to single line that was mentioned back in S1. 

2) Second Pick: Iron-Blooded Orphans (IBO):

I really struggled making the decision on my second pick, however I decided IBO was on top at the end. Unlike past series which either alluded to or were inspired by past series, the majority of this series you could make an argument story wise was very original. Really the only standout I found that really harkened back to any past series was that Kudelia is the hotest version of Relena yet (for those that know the meme). The music, world, and themes also were knockout as well. Unlike most Gundam series which tend to show a darker middle section half way through (Gundam 00 and Gundam Seed/Seed Destiny), this series inverted this making the middle section much more uplifting compared to its darker end (which if you know the writer of the series makes sense). Another interesting thing I found is that IBO focused way more on Economics more so than past series which tended to put more weight on the political side rather than economic (00 Balanced this but still stuck much more to the political side rather than economics). I also found I connected far more with the characters in IBO more than any other Gundam series so far. Both in terms of timing of the growth and the amount of growth shown by many of the characters made them seem like the most lifelike. If it was solely an argument of Characters for ratings I would honestly rate IBO as number 1 over all the other series. IBO currently is second solely because of my preference to having a brighter ending rather than the darker ending we got in IBO (also salty as they killed off my number 1 waifu pick in the way they did). I'm not sure if this will stay here in the future, in reality I may raise this to my number 1 given time given how good of a story it is, especially given how lack luster the other options are. 

3)Third Pick: Gundam Seed/Gundam Seed Destiny (GS/GSD):

I have to say I have sweet memories of GS/GSD despite all the hate. I think a lot of it has to do with the fact it was the first major gundam series I saw (didn't see the original airing but watched it online during my middle school years). The major issue I found when watching GS/GSD over again quite literally is an issue of pacing given how much the anime industry has changed since the original airing. The pacing is slow especially if you are used to the 12 episode a season structure. The remaster could have easily fixed this by cutting out portions of the series that didn't need to be there but they decided to cut minimal amounts. That being said I think the world and technology involved are a lot more interesting compared to some instances of IBO (which largely doesn't visit actual known Earth locations like USA or Victoria). Another big weakness of GS more so than GSD is that it definitely takes from the original Gundam anime (could also be counted as a strength if you haven't seen it like I did during my first viewing). The one big highlight I want to make though is that the Music is arguably some of the best music in the series, if you haven't heard of TM Revolution, Chemistry, High and Mighty Color, I suggest you go and listen to their music. 

4) Fourth Pick: Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn RE:00096

It hurt me to put Unicorn as my fourth. But the sad reality is that you are far better off watching the OVA series rather than the 24 Episode Anime. The anime is just a rehashed/ almost recut version of the OVA, and from what I could tell, nothing extra got added to the anime that improved the OVA version. Its sad but on that basis I couldn't rate it above GS/GSD on the grounds that a better version exists which captured my attention more than the anime. If you are new and don't know, Unicorn was a light novel that was adapted into an OVA due to popularity and then was redone again into an anime. Why this happened is up to you to guess. I will say that the added music selection was a highlight but I wouldn't say its a must to watch it. I found the music choices from the OVA better overall for the most part. 

Bottom Pick: Gundam AGE: 

Not sure if I'd call this the worst Gundam series ever, but its definitely near the bottom of the list for me. Music doesn't really hit home for the series in my opinion and in fact I would make some arguments it almost seems mismatched in certain parts. I also found it kind of all over the place in terms of story and character development as well. The easiest explanation I could find a reason why for this comes from it trying to do everything and all at once. I mean there are a lot of allusions to past series and it felt rushed. I found the exception being Asemu's story arc, being the easiest to swallow of the series, with Kio's story really just being a carry on to Asemu's story. Even in trying to force myself to re-watch it, I struggled hard to get to Asemu's story and it hurt to even go through that arc. I also found that this was also the series I remembered the least about. Even amongst the series I only watched once I still remember more from those than I do AGE. I probably wouldn't recommend this unless you are wanting to know the back history for mobile suits used in the Gunpla Diver series as many important units in Diver share/bare similarities to the AGE Units. And even then I would still recommend the Gunpla series over this. 

Gunpla Series Given How long I've made this post I'll just give my quick thoughts rather than my full opinion: 

1) Gundam Build Fighters + GM no Gyakushuu

Best overall being the best out of the 'children show' gundam spinoffs. Also Rinko Iori is best anime MILF lol. 

2) Gundam Build Divers Re:Rise 

Found the actual story of Divers Re:Rise surprisingly good while still going back to the events of the first series. I think for a younger audience Build Divers probably fits the mold better overall but Re:Rise does a good job being a 'darker' kids story. 

3) Gundam Build Fighters Try + Island Wars

I would almost argue this does fan service in the right way especially for those that I have seen G Gundam. If music in hype + battle scenes were the only things that mattered I would have a tough time figuring out this between the original build fighters and this. 

4) Gundam Build Divers

This definitely seems to strike the best middle balance between Build Fighters and AGE in terms of audience target. It's 100% perfect family night Gundam series, probably the only reason why I rated it this low is because the other series definitely hit it out of the park in terms of music and character development where is this is much more like character stagnation (much more tell rather than show).",False,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,95650,public,self,,,Thoughts and Reflections on the Past 20 years of Gundam,0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/l0452r/thoughts_and_reflections_on_the_past_20_years_of/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As an ""esteemed internet personality"" once said:

""It seems that most of the creative choices that Yoshiyuki Tomino made for this movie exist because the movie has to movie or the movie will be no movie""

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9cYpwUeGGQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9cYpwUeGGQ) (unrelated video)

In essence the primary problem with CCA is that it cares little for naturally making a story and instead it's primary goal is to shove Amuro Ray and Char Aznable into big robots that fight each other. This predictably is a huge detriment to both of their characters, it's to the point it comes off like Tomino had been given a plot synopsis for MSG and Zeta as well as character bios for both Char and Amuro and used that to make the movie without ever having seen a single episode of either series. What makes that so weird is that he directed both of those series.

Now I will talk about both of the characters, starting with Amuro since he is easier to talk about and was just as gutted as char was.

CCA Amuro is incredibly boring, having little character outside of calling out char for being stupid, he has no goals other than opposing char. Amuro should not have been a federation forces pilot, at least not a regular one in a standing army. It is likely that Amuro's primary goal that he works towards is trying to prevent humanity from making the same mistakes that it had in the previous 3 wars. Being Lt. Ray of Londo Bell does not help move towards that goal, he is just sitting there twiddling his thumbs waiting for something bad to happen (which it inevitably will and does). Amuro's arc in Zeta was him deciding to participate and try to make the world a better place after having sat and done nothing for the past 8 years, not opposing the titans like he should have been doing. Being in the federal forces also undermines any attempt he could make to try to forward his goals since the federation has no interest in what he has to say. Post Zeta Amuro is not the type who would just sit in the federal forces, even if he would strap into a gundam when Char starts doing something stupid.

So what could amuro have been doing instead? (Feel Free to post your own ideas in the comments)

My personal favorite idea is that Amuro works as an instructor in the federal mobile suit academy. Amuro's primary skill is that he is a top rate ms pilot and this is a place where he could be putting his talents to work, the federation would also be overjoyed to have him there, teaching fresh meat how to fight and die, taking as many zeeks with them as possible. But what makes Amuro accept the position is that it puts him in a place where he can seek out newtypes. These young newtypes he could then either dissuade from pursuing military careers or mentor them to try and prevent them from making the same mistakes that he and Char made. Even with non newtypes this position could give him power to change the federal forces from the inside out. Doing his small yet important part to try and shift towards a better tomorrow.

Char is a lot more obviously tampered with in order to get him to do something silly like dropping asteroids. It is something I could see him doing but not for the reasons the movie implies.

Char's, or rather Casval's motives are similar to Amuro's, that being that he wants to prevent humanity from making the same mistakes over and over again, where he differs from Amuro is that he believes that his father's ideals are the road to doing this. Amuro and Char should be working together to forge a better future for humanity since it is what they both want, however instead of working together in the end they bickered and fought because Char's pursuit had been twisted. The fact that CCA doesn't explore how Char went from trying to pursue his fathers ideals to corrupting them to a version even more bastardized than even the stuff Gihren Zabi said in speeches is a giant missed opportunity. Seriously, watching Char's fall would have made watching the eventual splat on the ground far more interesting.  


There is also that Char's motivations in the movie are not quite clear at best and are hilariously out of place at worst. Lets start with the stuff Char preaches, in a nutshell ""Drop asteroids on earth so that humanity is now only in space and evolves into newtypes/learns responsibility."" This is in line with a corrupted version of Zeon Deikun's teachings, however the movie implies that this is not Char's main motivations. Why I think that is the case is that Char is not an honest person so we should take what he preaches with a grain of salt. We can tell Char is dishonest because Char Aznable does not exist, he is a character that Casval Deikun created for the sole purpose of getting revenge on the zabis. If Casval was being honest he would be present himself as Casval because that is who he is. So how can we trust Char's word as true when Char himself is false? Why has Casval decided to take up that character again after having created another character, Quatro Bajeena, specifically to distance himself from being Char? If Char was a character created for revenge than it makes sense that Casval would use the character for another revenge, but against who? The only possible answer the movie gives is Amuro, and what reason would Char hate Amuro? Because Amuro killed Lalah. Lalah is brought up time and time again in the movie to the point where I am convinced that revenge for lalah is Char's primary motivator in the movie. The most notable time she is brought up is in Char's final words where he says ""Lalah was meant to be a mother to me!"" This makes no sense as motivation because Char and Amuro had already been through this, first at A Bo Qu where Char doesn't kill amuro despite wanting to. and Second in Zeta where the pair talk about lalah and how they are haunted by her like mature adults instead of fighting again like children.

Something would have had to been a catalyst for Char's transformation to where he is bringing up old grudges and twisting his father's ideals into something to tell young men and women to go fight and die, newtypes included. My favorite idea for how he could get there is this:  


 (again, feel free to submit your own)

Char emerges soon after the 1st Neo Zeon war as Casval Deikun and becomes a member of the federation government (He was a federation hero more than a zeon one at this point in time). He rises through the system, assisted by people such as Amuro who share the same goals. Things seem to be going well at first time goes on Casval sees how he is unable to make any real change, the deeper he gets into the system the more and more he has to dilute his father's ideals because they will not survive in this corrupt government. Frustrated with the EF's refusal to change and his own inability to do anything, as well as an approaching limit to his term, Casval starts to draw up more drastic plans, not too drastic yet buyt drastic, perhaps ones involving a leaderless neo zeon who have spent the past few years waiting for an opportunity to do something. He becomes more reclusive and isolated, his friendship with Amuro wanes. And then at the worst possible time something really really bad happens, something that pushes Casval over the edge so hard that he goes to Neo Zeon and reintroduces himself as Char Aznable and tells them he will lead them on a revenge quest against the earth federation. So begins the Second Neo Zeon war and Amuro is forced once again to pilot a Gundam against his former rival and colleague. I like this explanation because it lends even more weight to certain lines such as when amuro speaks about intellectuals and revolutions.

  
Amuro should also use Char's words against him, trying to get him to snap out of this because he has become someone worse than the zabis. While the zabis dropped a colony and used a bastardized version of zeon's ideals to start a war and take over the world, Char is doing THE EXACT SAME THING out of childish frustration. Perhaps these words could snap Char back to reality and make him realize too late what he had been doing. Or maybe not.... Char orders the neo zeon forces to attempt to push the falling axis away from the earth and the federal forces attempt to help out. This is what triggers the psyco frames of the nu gundam and sazabi to go nuts and cause a green light to appear and move axis away from the earth against all odds. In their last moments Char and Amuro's combined efforts saved the world and they are able to hope that since they learned from their mistakes than maybe humanity can follow in their example.  


(that's enough pretending I can write better than Tomino)  


In conclusion, I despise the movie for doing the most boring thing it possibly could do with two characters I loved in order to cram them into a movie where they fight each other. I feel so empty watching the nu gundam fight the sazabi to the most epic soundtrack ever. HOW DOES THAT EVEN HAPPEN!? It happened because I found it impossible to care about these two new characters who only look like Amuro and Char.  


(While I am still not fond of the Beltorchika's Children manga due to it having many of the same issues that the movie had, I do like it better because it is implied that char really was dropping axis out of his twisted ideals which I think could be completely in character for him. His last words are of a thankful nature, happy that his sister who he loves so much will survive.)  


(Speaking of Sayla she absolutely needed to be in the movie, I know changing a character's VA is a scummy thing to do especially in japan but she just really needed to be there)

(Someone is inevitably gonna bring up that char did what he did in cca because of what happened to kamile. I do not buy into this, as far as the movie is concerned kamille does not exist given that he is never mentioned or alluded to, and you would think that if kamille was important to char's motives he would at least be brought up, right?

The movements are very unrealistic and it gets progressively bad as the fight goes on. At some point, the Gundam and the mobile armor start moving impossibly fast. The concept of time in this scene seems to be thrown out of the window as well. The characters that are watching the fight are reminiscent of how characters in DBZ watch Goku or Vegeta fight, even saying things like: ""I can't see their movements"".

I know people LOVE this scene, but I can't help but see everything that is wrong with it. I think Gundam should always be plausibly realistic; it's what sets it apart from everything else.

I began my venture into Gundam only a few months ago, after I watched all of 0079 (the show, not the movies). After Garma died and the plot got into full-gear, that's when it all clicked and I pretty much binged it in a week. I then watched The Origin, followed by all of the OYW spinoff shows (08th MS Team, MS IGLOO, Thunderbolt, and War in the Pocket) with the only exception being Stardust Memory. And I loved every single one of them. It was with all that under my belt that I approached Zeta, and I **loved it.**

**The Good:**

While it took a few episodes for me to like Kamille (mostly thanks to characters punching him until he learned, lol), seeing all of the tragedies that filled his life unfold made me really engaged. &gt;!The final fight was just 6 minutes of goosebumps as by the end I legitimately found myself tearing up. Goddamn I was not expecting the last two episodes to kick me in the balls and rip them out.!&lt;

The crew of the Argama were almost equal to the White Base in my eyes, with absolutely everyone getting fleshed out at faster and more consistent rates than the WB crew did. Even characters that didn't get a lot of focus like Apolly and Robert stay strong in my memory. And then, it totally surpassed the WB when I realized that all of the women were out on the battlefield and very much capable of holding their own. Something that was a VAST improvement over Sayla's rough piloting skills in the middle part of 79, which was all we really got. There is just no comparing Fa to Fraw Bow, who I felt was kind of a wasted character in 79. I loved Fa, I loved Emma, and uh... Reccoa. She exists, I'll talk about her later on.

Speaking of the White Base crew, I loved the way they came back. While I wish that we saw more of Kai and ESPECIALLY more of Sayla, that one moment where she appears during Quattro's speech was worth it. I really like what they did with Amuro and Char, now being allies who can talk to each other. It was fascinating to see how they could never let go of Lalah, and being aware of how that same trauma was now happening to Kamille with Four. I loved Four, and feel like she was the right approach at evolving the character concept that Lalah established in 79. I guess I liked Rosamia too, but I feel like she was just a fabricated character who was there to basically repeat what was established already with Four, in case a casual weekly viewer was unable to follow Four's journey which happened throughout most of the show. I also wanna say that I liked Sarah, and even found her reasoning for thirsting over Scirocco far more sensical than Reccoa.

Last but not least, I really loved the Titans as villains. I feel like it was a surprisingly organic follow-up to 79, and you can absolutely see why they're so despicable right from the start. The idea of Cyber-Newtypes and weapons like the Psycho Gundam were interesting to see. I really want to highlight Scirocco, who was a pretty interesting character of whom I have mostly neutral opinions on. Which brings us to, oh lord...

**The Bad:**

So, uh, Reccoa. The show began with her being an experienced badass in the AEUG who was an important pillar to the Argama. Then &gt;!she crossed eyes with Scirocco and that might as well have been the instant the writers decided to throw her character out the window, burn it, and then bury it in literal crap. Her motivations to joining the Titans and keep being loyal to them were just stupid. I hate her and I hate what they did to what was a perfectly fine character just for the purpose of giving more emotional scars to Kamille.!&lt;

This is also why I'm neutral on Scirocco. Sure, he's memorable in everything he does, but I cannot forgive the way in which he singlehandedly &gt;!ruined Reccoa. Also, while the Final Battle of the show nearly made me cry, I still feel like Scirocco being the ""final boss"" was not deserved.!&lt;

This might be the ""Bad"" section, but now I wanna talk about a character I truly loved and yet is the other source of my problems: Jerid. He begins as a selfish asshole, who's kind of incompetent at first but who has the goal of one day leading the Titans himself. And then the entire show just... Kinda forgets about that goal? He becomes the recurring enemy, and he's great, but I feel like after the first few episodes his goal becomes completely forgotten. One could make a case that, after losing Lila and Mouar, his mental state wasn't the best, but I still can't let go of how he mentioned that goal in the early episodes but then is quickly forgotten about. Also, while the last 2 episodes of Zeta &gt;!were death after death, I feel like Jerid and Kamille's last duel was VERY underwhelming. Idk if that sounds petty, but I feel like they deserved an entire episode to fight, rather than the weird way in which he ends up being defeated.!&lt;

**Jerid &amp; Scirocco should've swapped roles in the last 10 episodes:**

Think about it. Jerid's initial goal was to become the Leader of the Titans. I feel like it would've been a perfect way to retake that plot point and also make the Final Battle far more climactic if it was Jerid who assasinated Jamitov and took control of the Titans. This also ties with my belief that Jerid would've been a much better final antagonist, if after all the emotional sacrifices he managed to achieve his goal to be the Leader of the Titans, but it all rapidly crumbles down by the same hand who caused all of his previous grief: Kamille. I can also picture Jerid thinking of Lila, Kacricon and Mouar while clashing against Kamille and the ""spirits"" of Four, Sarah, Katz and Rosamia.

**Conclusion + ZZ First Impressions:**

This show exceeded any and all expectations I had. The ending is so emotional and kind of ambigious, that the way ZZ begins just makes me feel pure pain for Kamille and Fa, who definitely deserve some time to rest while a new crew takes on the spotlight. 16 episodes into ZZ, it isn't nearly as bad as people constantly warned me. I feel like it was a nice change of pace after Zeta's gruesome finale, and the cast is likeable so far with the exception of Beecha. I don't find the humor jarring, I didn't find the MoonMoon Arc insulting, and the only thing that actually bothers me is how Bright seems to be completely fine despite having LITERLLY LOST 80% OF HIS CREW WITHIN A SINGLE BATTLE JUST 2 EPISODES BEFORE THE START OF ZZ.

Needless to say, I've fallen in love with the Gundam franchise, and I can't wait to get through ZZ and end the main UC conflict with Char's Counterratack.

Now not counting Perfect Strike, which was an Orb thing, The Strike was obviously more powerful then say a Ginn, but It's performance pewters off fairly quickly. it was always going up against 4 other gundams in the beginning, and on earth nothing Zaft had could get through it's armor outside of the lagowe (Beam Sabers). Kira started becoming a far more effective pilot and utterly trashed Bacues with ease,  but i dont really recall him fighting that many zaft mobile suits at once. He almost always went up against the 4 other gundams.

After the mid season crash, Kira gets punted into the Freedom(4 times as powerful as the Strike) and the Strike is given to Mu. From that point forwards the strike  doesn't really stand out in Mu's hands. Sure he can take down Strike Daggers but those are weaker versions of the strike any way, and they were quickly upgraded to the 105 dagger.

The strike does prove able to hold it's own vs the Guiaz and Cgue, but i dont think Strike is ever pitted against the TPA Gundams (Raider, Calamity and Forbidden) and yet gets utterly trashed vs the Providence.

Later in Destiny, Kira goes up in the Strike Rouge, which asides from slightly better Phase Shift armor, isn't any Stronger then the OG Strike. He's able to defeat Zaku's and Goufs while trying to get to the ship, but he quickly gets decimated. (Unless we count the remaster in which he kicks way more ass but still gets trashed) However, is that the strike's power, or just Kira's superior piloting skills?

So while keeping the Strike's performance in mind, we should look at his Children in the Dagger line. the Strike Dagger was super stripped down, and featured almost nothing of the strike's abilities outside of beam weapons (Which were yellow, i think that meant they were lower power) and laminated armor, which ironically meant the Strike Dagger was most resistant to beam weapons then the OG Strike. It could easily take on a Ginn, and once they fixed the crippling weakness of no EMP shielding, The Strike Dagger held up just fine against... pretty much anything that wasn't a gundam. they even show a Dagger 1 hit kill a Guiaz(the GM wishes it could be so cool)

After this we have the 105 Dagger, which is the True mass produced vision the Earth Forces had in mind. the 105 Dagger is better in every way then the Strike Dagger, and can equip Striker packs. Still inferior to the Strike Gundam of course but not quite so much as the Strike Dagger.

Following this we hit the period between the wars and we have the Dagger L which if i recall was an intermediary upgrade to the 105 dagger, an over haul but otherwise not really much more effective. Got a few new Striker packs.

And finally the Windam, which is suppose to be on par with the strike despite having over 3 years of advances in technology. The best they could do with their main line unit was make it roughly equal to a severely outdated mobile? The Windams seems to pale in comparison to the Zaku Warriors and Gouf Ignited. Kira in the strike was only just able to hold his own against those suits and he's a far better pilot then most, How the hell are the Windam suppose to hold out against the Zaft suits? they die in Droves in the show and i dont think they make a single good showing in the entirety of Destiny.

Or... is the strike actually a really powerful mobile suit that only the best pilots could make the most of and the Windam falls into the same category? So powerful that it's able to stay on par with Modern Mobile suits?

Nothing I've read about the *Gundam AGE* series seems good, and I had no interest to watch it in its entirety. But after seeing some of the openings, I wanted to experience that sweet, sweet animation style. After some inner-conflict, I decided to purchase the Blu-Ray for the movie and finally watch it.

I really dug about three-fourths of the two-part movie. I love everything in the first part, the beginning and final battle in the second part, but everything that had to do with the third and fourth story arcs from the original AGE TV show was a big low-point. What made *Memory of Eden* so great was the relationship between Asemu and Zeheart, so when that relationship takes a backseat, the story stops being as good. The two parts could've just been one movie, and ended adequately enough at the end of the second arc; just add an epilogue and I would have been satisfied.

Even though the movies only showed a super rushed version of the third and fourth arcs, I could tell those arcs aren't that good. It's also in those scenes where you realized that AGE doesn't treat female characters that well. Romary almost completely disappears, only serving to be Asemu's baby-momma. Her sudden absences make the story feel so disjointed, as a big aspect of the first part is the relationship between Asemu, Zeheart, and Romary. Fram is presented as being a capable soldier, yet ends up just being just a lovestruck woman.

With all the said, *Memory of Eden* has some of my favorite visuals in all of Gundam. The scene where the main trio sits outside in space, while the lights of the colony turn on, is a stunning moment. The rivalry between the two leads is executed really well. Despite being a common anime trope, their relationship I felt was handle in a way that made the story feel fresh. The final fight between Zeheart's Legilis and Asemu's Dark Hound is legitimately one of my favorite fights in the franchise. The choreography is spectacular, and the camera and the visuals made it look really pretty. Seeing the Dark Hound use its hooks to dig into the Legilis is really awesome.

In general, I will say I really liked *Memory of Eden*; in fact, I could say I like it a lot! But if anything, the two-part movie has now encouraged me to **not** watch the show. The parts that focused on the third and fourth arcs were easily the weakest moments in the films, and it didn't make me care enough to bother watching the show to get the greater context. I think *Memory of Eden* short-of works as a standalone feature, so I would say watch it, even if you haven't seen the series.",True,True,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,95409,public,spoiler,,,Impressions on Gundam Age: Memory of Eden (SPOILERS),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/kxpwa3/impressions_on_gundam_age_memory_of_eden_spoilers/,,all_ads,6,discussion,83f4319a-5fa5-11e7-8e79-0ec8348f5b38,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WAR AND DEVELOPMENT HISTORY 
 
This war started off as a rebellion against the super power ruling Earth, known as Malefique. The rebellion was a group of working classes that stole mobile workers and attacked a Malefique patrol station. The survivors stated that the reasoning behind why they attacked was because of how the patrols treated them. They would break their equipment and if they had a mobile suit they would knock down a pillar or two, there is also all the little stuff that they did such as spit at them and throw trash. The patrol unit was the 27th patrol unit, they were later given the title “The Great 27th” by Malefique because they destroyed five of the seven mobile workers with one standard Rike-W. Rike-Ws are the standard grunt mobile suit of Malefique. The patrol unit inspired supporters of Malefique but the workers inspired so many others to fight against Malefique.
 
The people who were the most inspired, made gatherings of people and preached of Malefique’s Evil doings. The more gatherings that were held the more the leaders of Malefique became worried, so they started sending Rike-Ws to shoo off all of the gatherers. But this only made the rebellion angrier. They stole mobile workers and equipped them wih weaponry and used them as guards for the gatherings to fight the Rikes.
 
With the massive groups being formed against Malefique, People with power started to support them and generals of Malefique left to join. The rebellion eventually earned themselves a name, Bons Tueurs. 
With all of the support the rebellion had gained, they eventually started developing their own Mobile suits to fight against Malefique. The FXMS units
 
Years had passed and Malefique and Bons Tueurs  Were still fighting and they pretty much had the same amount of power to fight. People of Bons Tueurs heard rumors that Malefique would soon be launching a space fleet to fight the rebellion from above. Bons Tueurs too launched a space fleet to fight Malefique. But Malefique’s modifications to the RIke-W to make it combat ready for space combat had great designs. Bons Tueurs units on the other hand, had armor that was in large parts so it was hard to make modifications for space combat without removing a lot of the armor. This gave Malefique the upper hand.
 
After the space war had started, Malefique changed it’s name to Flotte Malefique. Their time to prepaid for space was much greater than Bons Tueurs. Giving them the upper hand. After 2 years of fighting and mostly losing, Bons Tueurs Developed their first G-unit, Gidem. FXG-01 Gidem, designed by Trevor John GIdem, was perfectly made for space travel and combat. Only one was made but they decided only one G-unit is made for each model.
They eventually made 22 G-units, their newest being Frontier. They became stronger than Flotte Malefique and usually won battles. The next unit they made was the Rival Puroto. And while in development of this G-unit, a pilot school was made. So they could get better pilots to fight in the FXMS Space types. After the Rival Puroto three more were made, the Rival, Firen and Tige Chaud. The Tige Chaud was also a prototype that used exhaust instead of regular ventilation. These three became the new face of Bons Tueurs army and it was the first three mobile suits to truly achieve “high” mobility, it inspired others to become pilots and try to become good enough to pilot a Gundam.
 
Two more G-units were being developed and before they were finished, they were stolen, the two G-units were Renzis and Ghuren. After the theft of the two G-units, Bons Tueurs developed Garos and Raqueus another attempt to steal them was made but Flotte Malefique only managed to get Raqueus.
 
Flotte Malefique used technologies from the three G-units they stole and created the Rike-Z. The Rike-Z has a specially programmed AI called adaptors that are connected in the head of the Rike and if needed a Manuel cockpit is available. It has much better mobility in space than the Rike-W due to added thrusters in the chest and shoulders.
 
Three new G-units were made after Bons Tueurs discovered the Rike-Z. Of the three, only one was successful and the other two were prototypes to make a transformable G-unit but they used other frames of G-Units and they were to weak to hold together while shifting into the fighter jet mode and ultimately fell apart during testing. The Collin was non transformable but a great advance in technology to have leg thrusters that are powerful enough to make it a high mobility suit and small enough to not hinder the performance of it, it was one of the fastest G-units made.
 
It was a few years after the Collin was made when Bons Tueurs made a new G-unit, and the new G-unit made was the Trilos. The Trilos was the successor to the two failed G-units that fell apart during testing, Priden and Kuen. Trilos had a completely new frame to help it transform into a fighter jet. It had brand new weapons made for it too so the weapons could integrate into the jet. In the mobile suit mode it was still really fast but in fighter jet mode,  nothing could catch up to it.
 
Flotte Malefique stole Trilos in a surprise attack after a battle and Bons Tueurs lost their greatest weapon.
 
Bons Tueurs launched as many G-units as possible into battle to destroy Trilos. But every time a G-unit came close, it was destroyed. All five Alter G-units were destroyed, Frontier, Rival Puroto, Nuire, Polipene and Laramie were the other G-units destroyed.
 
After the destruction of 10 G-units Flotte Malefique decided to develop a new machine to finally destroy Bons Tueurs. The Rike-X was their greatest work. It was an Upscaled Rike-Z with beam cannons on the chest, a large beam rifle, 4 arms attracted to the back with large shields with thrusters attached and the shields could hold a mobile suit in each one. It was able to transform into a large cone shaped rocket for ramming into larger ships or for travel.
 
The Rike-X hasn’t been used yet and Bons Tueurs already had gotten news of it so they started development on the biggest G-unit yet, the G-0.
 
The G-0 was made to rival the capabilities of what they heard of the Rike-X. It was heavily armored and had a large backpack with fuel tanks and large thrusters to help with movement. It had a particle beam cannon mounted on both of the forearms and had a custom made large double barrel beam rifle. It’s head was quite small compared to the rest of the mobile suit because it had a small G-unit inside for escape if needed. The smaller G-unit inside had a standard FXMS beam rifle and very little armor.
 
FINAL BATTLE SECTION
 
In the last battle of the space war the Rike-X faced off with the G-0. The Rike-X brought along the four stolen G-units for battle and the G-0 had the Collin and the Tige Chaud for support, and at the end of the battle the army general came to fight in the Gidem.
 
The Rike-X and the G-0 were evenly matched at the start of the battle and as the battle progressed the difference between the two started to show. The Rike-X’s power supply depleted much quicker than the G-0’s. So as the two mobile suits fought the Rike-Z started to slow down but in a hand to hand fight between the two, the Rike-X activated the two Beam cannons on it’s chest and fired directly into the G-0. As the G-0 was being fired at it activated it’s particle beam cannon on it’s right arm and shot the Rike-X in the chest. 
 
Blinding light was shining every where. Nobody on the battlefield could see who won. When the light disappeared the outline of a massive mobile suit was floating their. Debris of the Rike-X was floating around the G-0. The G-0 held up the head of the Rike-X to show victory.
 
After the battle people talked about how the G-0 didn’t run out of power as quickly as the Rike did. People nicknamed the unit from it’s capability to have a strong battery and they called it,

I don't care that he's a teen. There is no excuse for murdering an innocet, nor it's an excuse that she killed his crush so it's fine. And the best part is that Chan was trying to save him because Quess didn't care about him.

 Some people have even said that it's the same thing as for Lalah and Amuro or Jerid and Four. First of all Amuro didn't wall to kill Lalah, she shielded Char. And second...  Jerid, really?

If you need to compare a character to him it already means that the character you want to defend is wrong.

I don't really know a lot about his novel, all  I know is that he gets executed at the end and the thought is making me extremely happy. The only other gundam character that made me this angy is probably Reccoa (who also murdered innocent people) and I ***cheered*** when she died.

Every Gundam series is rough in some way. For Wing this remains true. The words for Wing is overdramatic, has too many coups, and is a tad too long.

Let's first discuss the antagonist. But which one? We had three coups and a rebel army. This was super confusing. Especially when they use the signature bad guy mechs against each other. It was messy and unneeded. Honestly most of the length on this show is due to the coup and rise of a new faction only for it to get back stabbed  by another inner faction multiple times. Makes the antagonist feel less impactful and constantly makes me question just how incompetent these people are to keep allowing these coups.

That goes into length of the show. Wing is 49 episodes long. This is the first Gundam  show that I wish was much shorter. The story probably didn't need as many coups or episodes but I think the length is due to juggling 6 protagonist and the coups. 

The pilots and Reelena each get a moment or 2. Although I think ultimately if Wu fei wasn't in the show it wouldn't effect much. He is just another edgy boi.

The women. Besides Sally, all the women have a guy that they define themselves by. This seems like a older 90's sensibility. While all capable, they exist only for their man. While noin did help at first, as soon as she saw Zechs after he went insane, she bowed her head and said ""I'll stay by your side"". Disappointing. Une turned out to be mentally ill. That came out of nowhere. But otherwise existed to support Treize. Dorothy. I honestly don't know. She seemed to get excited to see fighting. Please enlighten me on her. Reelena. Well we all know the meme.

What was the message? Obviously another war is bad story. This time it seemed like too many messages from the antagonist side. One was peace is achieved by us pointing a gun at your head so you'll do nothing. Treize was everyone should be a soldier so they can earn peace. Zechs was like Chars except there was no added bonus of mankind evolving into new types. Just all very confusing. Also all very dogmatic. 

I know I'm being overly negative so I shall be positive now. Mech designs and the action were fantastic. Besides G Gundam this was probably the most action packed Gundam of them all up to this point. That's a good or bad thing depending on the viewer. I'm in the middle. It sometimes benefits the show or makes the show have an excuse for another episode. I actually like most of the pilots. Duo,Trowa, and Quatre are great. I feel like Sand Rock and Heavy arms got shafted in the upgrade department. They didn't really get retooled. Especially Sand Rock. He got nothing new.

Overall this was entertaining but to me this was the worst Gundam show I've seen yet. I own After War X, and Turn A. So those are next. I want Victory and Reconguista but must wait due to financials. Waiting for seed on Bluray.  Have no interest in the builder series. Not sure if I want Age or NT. NT is way to expensive for a movie and Age didn't get the greatest reviews.

To even up the playing field, Meijin will be fielding the Amazing Gundam Exia in its complete form (prior to its rushed conversion into the Exia Dark Matter)

**Round 2:** Desert. Kyoya will be using the Try-AGE Magnum, while the Meijin will have the Amazing Red Warrior (I know this will probably be cheating to some extent, but it's probably the closest match.)

**Round 3:** Space. Throwing caution to the cosmic wind here, Kujo in the AGE-2 Magnum SV vs. Meijin in the Amazing Strike Freedom (debatable for sure, but considering that it got itself a regular HGBF kit release despite not being animated. And no, I'm not going the Amazing Full Amazing route for this bcoz that'll just turn it into a Deep Striker-level brick.)

Fast-forward to now. I've seen everything UC minus igloo, NT, and Victory. I own turn A and After war. Before I started those I decided to rewatch my old wing collection. 

At age 30 with a almost complete Bachelors in English degree I view stories very differently now. With that in mind and  am currently on episode 7, this show is a tad bananas. Wing does a good job of getting into the action pretty fast. The gundam pilots minus quatre and duo are super duper edgy bois to use a modern term. Women seem there to be their connected guys subservient lap dog. This makes me miss Emma from Zeta. Her lack of romantic interest in the men she was around was refreshing.

I do like the parallel of Oz in the Alliance to UC's Titans and EF. The Treize deception in episode 6 was interesting if not obvious. The Char clone, Zechs, is well done so far.

But neither the Lupus or Lupus Rex is the Calamity War design, they're huge deviations meant to fit Mika's combat style.

It doesn't really have a singular feature that sets it apart from the other suits, just a set of relatively basic melee weapons and the same compatible frame as the rest of the Gundams.

My first question is that does Bandai often re-issue these figures? I am seeing many different versions (assuming year?) of the MB Strike Freedom. Would I be stupid to purchase one right now at 3x the retail if there’s indeed a reissue around the corner? The Destiny Soul Red (2020 ver.) comes with the wing of light but somehow Strike Freedom Soul Blue does not? Do I have to purchase the wing of light set separately from previous releases? Would there be figment issues? Also, do these “higher end” figures yellow over time even if I don’t expose them to sunlight? Do the diecast joints loosen as well? Lastly, is Metal Composite similar time Metal Build? Because I’m interested in the MC Wing Zero as well...

Just before being destroyed the Devil Gundam downloads itself onto &amp; infects an escape pod with DG cells and launches into space. It quickly runs out of fuel and drifts until going into a black hole. It then is popped out of a white hole in the 00 time-line. It encounters an A-law scout ship by activating a distress call attracting the ship. Once brought close enough it attacks the ship and absorbs the tech &amp; infects the crew. 

The Devil Gundam moves towards earth and is quickly caught up to speed of the current events in that time-line (season 2 is when it arrives) via the on-board computers. Using the conflict in Season 2, the DG quietly overtakes the A-laws eventually infecting Ribbons. Finally, it fuses with Veda and launches an attack on humanity. Although the Gundams try to stop it, the DGs abilities fused with the 00 tech is too much with only Tieria escaping. 

The DG then comes up with a plan, ""why save one Earth from humanity when I can save ALL Earths?"". Thus, the DG uses Veda and it's own abilities to create a way to hop between time-lines. Each timeline it goes too, it evolves itself by fusing with the tech it discovers. It even infects various characters with DG cells to use them as lieutenants in its army (a DG Setsuna with a DG upgraded Gundam 00 Raiser for example). 

Eventually, the DG returns to the Future Timeline and quickly overpowers the shuffle alliance and colonies. With Domon as the last man standing, he prepares for a final unwinnable battle only to be rescued by the Zeta Gundam &amp; Arguma. Once onboard, he discovers that a small group of survivors from each ruined timeline are banding together to take the DG down. The ship is under the command of Bright (from Zeta) with various pilots such as Kamille, Tierria, Char (as quatro), Trowa, Gato, (others join too) and some support staff like Nina (someone's gotta fix their gundams). 

The series focuses on them gathering forces and battling the DGs forces before a final winner take all battle with the Devil Gundam itself.

Ideally you should avoid running military vehicles under their own power as much as feasibly possible so that they remain in good condition for when you actually need them, that means you need to be able to move them around. THe issues with mobile suits is that they are HUGE and likely very heavy, which means to ship them around you need vehicles big and powerful enough to move them (as well as recovery vehicles to retrieve them when they are too damaged to even try and move on their own). You will also need the roads, bridges and railways big and strong enough to support those transport vehicles. These things are so absolutely necessary that maybe the best defense against an invasion from mobile suits would be not having the necessary infrastructure so any would be invader wouldn't attack you since they would have to bust their economy building the infrastructure after they have conquered you.   


You could argue that in the original MSG that zeon has circumvented this problem by primarily using air and hovercraft to transport mobile suits around. The problems is that hovercrafts are very limited in the kind of terrain that they can traverse and aircraft still need infrastructure in the form of airfields, they would also need to be really big airfields to be able to utilize craft as large as Gaws. The best solution in the Universal century that we are shown is through minofsky craft such as white base and ships like it since they can go pretty much anywhere. But I would assume that they do not come cheap so it would be hard to equip an entire military with enough of them to move your mobile suits around.  


Side note: also worth mentioning is that minofsky craft are by far the most ridiculous """"""""non-magic"""""""" technology in the UC as they can make giant things float and in late UC can make things travel at significant percentages of the speed of light (are we sure it isn't magic????).",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,94943,public,self,,,Mobile Suit Logistics,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/ktorb6/mobile_suit_logistics/,,all_ads,6,discussion,83f4319a-5fa5-11e7-8e79-0ec8348f5b38,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is so comically edgy yet seemingly offers little to balance that edge out. It is very important that this is done because no one likes stories that are all darkness and despair and nothing else.

I only remember one joke from the movie, that one where it is implied that a zeon soldier likes a band because it is implied he &gt;!masturbates to pictures of the singer!&lt; other than that the movie is seemingly humorless.

But it is not, the humor comes in a more subtle variety. My favorite example is how “I’m your baby,” a song about becoming a couple, plays when Io and Daryl first meet and vow to kill each other. That is hilarious.

The other thing besides jokes that keep the movie funny is the shear absurdity of it all. The comical levels of edginess are just that, comical. In a dark sense it is funny watching zeon send cripples back into war where under normal circumstances would be out of the war. It is funny watching the federation send a bunch of kids to their deaths. It is funny watching zeon soldiers be unable to listen to reason and blow themselves up. It is funny watching Cornelius’ men misunderstand his genuine anti war speech as a distraction. December Sky is a straight up black comedy. 

And then there is Io. Io is an absurd character, he’s an asshole who talks down to everyone and blasts free jazz when he flies his mobile suit like some twisted macross character. He also tells a bunch of kids: “Drinks on me if you survive” and you cannot believe for a second that he is joking. Io is without a doubt hilarious. I also find Io ironically enough to sort of be the movie’s beacon of hope. Despite how horrible he is we see that he is fully aware of this and hates the war and the monster he has become. He expresses great dismay when the federation sends kids to die, he is shown to deeply care about those close to him. Io is in despair, a deeply human thing. This contrasts with daryl who I think stands in more for dehumanization. In a nutshell, while Daryl is the good man we are shown to not be as good as we may think, Io is the bad man who is not as bad as we may think.

Banagher's generally pacifistic piloting is perfectly justified by his character. He is unique among UC protagonists in that he is a civilian the whole way through, unlike Amuro, Kamille, Judau and the rest he never joins a side in the conflict, he is on his own side, one that wants to do good for all humanity, not for the federation, zeon, or himself. Also his goal is not to defeat the ones who stand in his way, it is to get from point A to point B. With these reasons killing is something Banagher does his best to avoid. Does he get punished for it? Yes he does, if he had not spared angelo he would not have been caught fighting him and would have been able to help Marida calm down Riddhe.  


Banagher is no more of a ""gary stu"" than any other UC protagonist. Just like many UC protagonists we see he has prior MS experience (even if not military). In the novel we see he has a part time job operating one of the petite mobile suits and in both the OVA and the novel Banagher uses one to save Mineva.  


On the subject of the novel I feel like the OVA leaves out a few things that do some damage to his character. In the OVA Banagher ""tells us"" he feels disjointed with his life. But in the novel we are shown it much more naturally. He goes to a friend's part and is unable to enjoy himself properly, showing us that he does not quite fit in with his surroundings. Another thing we miss out on is when he helps Mr. Gilboa's family while he is being held at Palau, this shows more of his kind nature and reinforces that he is never one to sit idly by and do nothing. I do wish that Unicorn put more effort into humanizing its cast members but the OVA did not help things with removing these scenes.  


Why is Banagher instantly ready to help Mineva? There are two main reasons. The first is that it is in his nature to do so, he still believes in the things his father taught him when he was very young, even if he cannot remember where those ideals came from in the first place. As mentioned before Banagher does not feel right in his ""normal"" surroundings and helping mineva is something that finally comes to him naturally.

First off I absolutely LOVE the character itself. She has that weird girl aesthetic to her which is kind of unique for older anime like this. Reminds me of some of the girls I've dated in my life. I can relate with Kamille's love for her and whatnot.

But the way the series approaches her is just...odd I guess? Ok so she BLOWS UP when helping Kamille and co. go back to space, right? If one thing in Gundam is consistent, an explosion = permadeath unless you see the pilot escape. Then all of a sudden she comes back in Africa which tbh I was down with (her character arc hasn't been fully explored even where I'm at in the series) despite the oddness of it. Then in the NEXT EPISODE she perma-dies when Jerid shoots her Gundam in the head. No time for her and Kamille to really develop as characters. :/

Was there some reason behind this? Did Tomino feel like he should've given Four a better ""send-off"" than the one she got earlier in the series?

The most specific coincidence (IMO) might be what the Mexican commander said upon the last three Legionaires agreed to surrender in exchange for medical supplies for their leader.  As Wikipedia relates it,

As far as I can tell, when it comes to the After Colony timeline Gundams, there are 3 different versions. You have...

•The original versions from the TV anime: Wing/Wing Zero, Deathscythe/Deathscythe Hell, Shenlong/Altron, Sandrock/Sandrock Kai, Heavyarms/Heavyarms Kai. This set of Gundams doesn’t have a particular name or designation.

•The Katoki redesigns from the Endless Waltz OVA: Wing Zero Custom, Deathscythe Hell Custom, Nataku, Sandrock Custom, Heavyarms Custom. We aren’t given any explanation for the redesigns in-universe when we see them in the OVA, it’s just a sort of nod-and-a-wink, “whaddaya mean, they’ve *aaaaalways* looked like that”. Despite being Katoki redesigns, they aren’t called “Ver Ka” and despite being from the Endless Waltz (EW) OVA, they aren’t called the “EW” versions either. Going forward, we’ll call these the “OVA versions”.

•The Glory of the Losers redesigns/upgrades: Wing/Wing Zero EW w/Drei Zwerg, Deathscythe/Deathscythe Hell EW/Deathscythe Roussette, Shenlong EW Liaoya/Nataku EW, Sandrock EW/Sandrock Armadillo, Heavyarms EW/Heavyarms Igel. 
These are *also* Katoki redesigns (as far as I know), but still aren’t referred to as “Ver Ka”. Instead, they *are* referred to as the “EW” versions, despite the fact that they have nothing to do with Endless Waltz, nor the OVA versions, instead being exclusive to the GoL manga. Henceforth, I’m gonna refer to these as the “manga versions”.

So, what I’m wondering about is: why aren’t the OVA versions called the EW versions? Why aren’t either of them called Ver Ka? Why is this so confusing? If anybody has any insight, please, help a fella out. And as long as we’re discussing it: which is your favourite “set” of After Colony timeline Gundams? For my part, it’s a toss-up between the OVA versions and the manga versions. I think the upgraded manga versions get pretty close to perfect, especially in the case of Sandrock Armadillo, Wing Zero Custom with the Zwerg Buster, and the Shenlong Liaoya (I think the TV Shenlong is probably the worst looking of the original cast). That said, OVA Nataku is my second favourite mobile suit *ever*, so. This has all just been on my mind since I’m getting close to finishing the first part of my bid to collect the AC main cast in all of its forms: I just need to track down an MG Heavyarms Igel Unit and I’ll have manga versions done. 

Anyways, cheers, I hope you’re all having a good 2021 so far. If you do take the time to weigh in, thanks for humouring me.

However, is it iust the concept the same (like kids involved involuntarily into the war between two „grey” sides, trying to make peace) or does even particular events in the show are almost the same?

This is my review/synopsis of After War Gundam X (“AWGX”).  I have seen a lot of Gundam over the years, and this show attracted me because it is notorious for being bad and getting it’s TV run cancelled early. I bought the dvds from Right Stuf for only like $15, and even though they were very basic, it was a good value, and a good year to watch a lot of TV.

-Bottom Line Up Front-

The first 10 episodes are pretty bad, the middle 20 are much better, and the last 10 are very rushed. I wouldn’t recommend the show except to a Gundam fan who is trying to see as much of the franchise as possible.

-The Premise-

15 years ago, the UNE and SRA (earth and space colonies) were at war. The SRA dropped colonies onto earth killing most of the population, destroying governments and infrastructure. 15 years later we meet our main characters who live in North America which is filled with Mobile Suit (MS) driving mercenaries known as Vultures. Which is really interesting, it felt like Mad Max with giant robots, and not unlike some Trigun premise where everybody is a hardcore gun-toting Vulture. I think that the show fails to consistently uphold this premise. The characters go to fancy french cafes on beautiful city streets, and never seem to have an inability to fix their mobile suits or run out of parts. Later on, the show explores factions in the world, like the UNE and SRA reforming themselves and trying again to dominate, despite the chaos they caused 15 years ago.

-The Mecha-  

They bear some resemblence to Gundam Wing, but aren’t quite as good.  The Leopard feels overdesigned; like if heavyarms had a bunch of extra random missiles tubes or machine guns. Airmaster is fine. The GX has a super cool Satellite Laser, but is a lot like the Wing Gundam. One of the The Frost Bros. Gundam is black and evil, and the other looks a LOT like Epyon. Think if Epyon had the claws that Wufei’s Gundam had. The SRA and UNE each have like 3 different grunt suits which is better than Wing who uses the Leo a little too much. The UNE has a flight suit that looks like a worse Aries from Gundam Wing, and even though it is brand new technology, it doesn’t challenge the heroes in any interesting way.
Since it is post-apocalypse, I really wanted to see a grungy and repurposed aesthetic, but most suits look new and uniform. I think IBO does this better by having Barabatos reuse parts from MS it defeats.

-Characters-

The MC, Garrod Ran, is interesting. He reminds me of the IBO MC a bit with his height, violence, and toughness. Although his character isnt consistent. He initially acts a lot like a kid, maybe to be more relatable to the target audience. He is cartoonishly interested in Adill at first, but it matures into a very tender and believable relationship between the two. He ends up going through a little arc and grows a fair amount.  

Tiffa Adill is a young girl, Newtype, from earth. Usually is targeted for capture by a villain. 

Jamil is a great character. He is the captain of the Freeden which is the ship for the good guys. He is a Newtype from the war, and a sort of failed Amuro Ray. When there isn’t anything going on with Garrod, Jamil will often be going through PTSD, or fighting to move past the ghosts of the war and his legacy of failure.

The other Gundam pilots aren’t great. Witz has some depth with his family motivations. Roabea has this swinger-playboy thing going on. His womanizing might’ve aged badly. They both come off early on as money-grubbing freelancers who are selfish. They both overlap as big brothers to Garrod. Ultimately they get very little development. Maybe about 1 total episode is dedicated to each one of them; and they are good standalone episodes. In a show about Gundams, these 2 gundam pilots are unimportant to the plot and don’t grow much. Less going on here than the least developed Gundam pilots from Wing.

Honorable mention to the ship’s doctor. He might be the only logical character that doesn’t get on your nerves in the first 10 episodes. You see, everybody on freeden gets in 90s melodrama misunderstandings where they slap each other and run away. It felt like they were unable to express their feelings. He just hangs out and smokes and provides wisdom without judgment.

The Frost Bros are pretty good villains. They initially are written in as rival vultures with some newtype powers; but we learn a lot more about them over they show. They appear in nearly every story arc as strong manipulators and driven by greed. I wish they got like 1 story arc break so we didn't have them all the time, and I wish we got some more of the differences. Younger is hot headed. Older is mission focused.

-Misc-

Characters and suits  (the art direction in general) looks a lot like Gundam Wing because the productions are only a year apart. In one case, a character is just Treize recolored with red hair. In a lot of these 90s shows battle damage is poorly animated, and it’s hard to tell sometimes if a suit is using lasers or bullets cause they are often just yellow flashes.  The writing can be lazy. I think they were unable to create believable dialogue and motivations for the characters early on. The narrator often introduced major plot points, such as: the Freeden crew decided to look for and protect newtypes.

-Plot Synopsis-Spoilers-

There are 2 or 3 little arcs in the first 10 episodes that get the Freeden crew together and have them coalesce as a team. They battle a science company who wants Tiffa’s Newtype powers and later a rival vulture crew with flamethrowers who wants to steal Gundams to sell. We meet the Frost Bros and Ennil El in these first 10 episodes who will develop more over time. Sadly, the show wastes a lot of times on vultures and other vulture teams; but the show leaves behind vultures and ends up focusing more the UNE and SRA and the legacy of the war.

From here on out, the show has a series of arcs each lasting about 4-5 episodes. Basically, the Freeden goes somewhere, maybe to find a newytpe, the frost brothers hang out to interfere, and the crew battles some evil guys while trying to help or free somebody who is good, or a victim being manipulated.

The ice arc. Really funny to see MS on snowboards. Great villain and cyber newtype Carrius. Really great development for Garrod to try and save this kid and not outright murder him. Cool redesign for the GX, although I thought we'd bounce back and forth between the 2. Like some sort of optional equipment. Sadly, I think this redesign is the best and last good piece of suit design in the show. First introduction of this theme about old people being tied up in the ghosts of the past war, and not learning from their mistakes. We will see more of this, and I like it and think this is where the show shines. Jamil getting into the cockpit is dope.

The ocean arc was also fine. More of the fish-out-of-water thing that gundam series often do where the MC and crew goes to some environment that isn't favorable to them, but the villains have grunt suits that are adapted to the environment. The dolphin thing might also be enough to be so bad its good. The villain refers to himself in the 3rd person and is cartoonishly evil. This was pretty good. The best episode is probably when they fight the Newtype lady in the crystal and use the g-bits. The G-bits have been sunk underwater for 15 years, and then activate hours later like it is no big deal that they have been corroding on the ocean floor for 15 years. Lots more development for Jamil who wants to move past the war, and has to face its legacy. He is really the second star I would say.

Fighting the UNE arc. This is where the Freeden crew battles the UNE on their science base island and it is a very strong arc. The Kartok character is awesome. Gundam has a good history of gruff old men who are really charismatic and complex. This is one of them. He saves his men, he wont hurt Tiffa, he wants revenge, he realizes he wants to move forward to the future. Neat little story arc for him that I think is supposed to be how most characters should be. If everybody on the planet had the same realization as Kartok, then no more war.   They get an upgraded GX, the Double X. The Frost Bros continue to shine as the only villains who tie together the whole show. Ennil El continues to be an interesting side character. Great decision by Garrod to use force to scare people and not just murder them. He is really coming into his own. Previously he was either a funny relate-able kid or battle-hardened post-apoc murderer. Even more growth for Jamil to realize what he had been/done during the war and how he affected normal people. The UNE scientist commander was forgettable even though he was introduced talking to the frost bros many episodes ago.

East Asia Arc. It was just okay. The characters they meet here are not that interesting.  There is a General who is haunted by the past and launches a suicide mission.  This sort of stuff causes the Freeden crew to think about who/why they are fighting, but ultimately keep doing it anyway.  Witz and Roabea upgrade their suits into units that are almost exactly the same but a different color. Not as good as the dramatic moonbase reveals of the upgraded shenlong and deathscythe from Gundam Wing. There are UNE soldiers who are proto-newtypes that function like a villain of the week. Interesting idea for this format, but ultimately it makes them forgettable. Just helps flesh out the Frost Bros as master manipulators. I think the design team once again missed an opportunity to create these truly unique post-apocalyptic societies. Instead we have a nearly idyllic city that knows nothing of the ravages of the apocalypse.  

-Plot Synopsis Final Arc-

At this point (post east-asia arc maybe episode 30 onward) brand new factions are being introduced. Brand new settings. Plot points are being introduced by the narrator because they couldn't draft dialogue to get the exposition out fast enough. These last 10 episodes or so bleed together and to be really rushed. I think ep 24-25 where they get the double X and win that arc were supposed to be the true halfway point, and these last 10 episodes contain 20 episodes. Which is a shame. The animation, generally had been meh. A few episodes and scenes in each arc look great; but, the space battles and ships have been animated better than usual here at the end.

Very quickly they re-establish this rivalry between the UNE and SRA, so that the series can end with them at war again. I think we might've benefitted from meeting these factions earlier on. Maybe they only thought it up as they went along? The plot moves really fast from here on out, and is not as good as a result.  The UNE is bad, they want to use NT power to control the new world. The SRA suits and uniforms are copying UC Zeon suits hard. So much so that it feels like a true AU. This is what happens if Amuro failed, char wins in CCA, and humanity is left to pick up the pieces.  

There is a quick little episode where the Freeden goes to the Newtype lab because the narrator said that they are trying to help and unify Newtypes still. The SRA abducts Tiffa by walking aboard the Freeden and using an escape helicopter. Garrod goes to space with the SRA with Ennil's help. Ennil has growth which is good for her.  It turned out that the Newtype lab has researchers who are from the SRA. SRA characters and scientists get very quickly introduced. The Freeden blows up, but there is no time to dwell on it now. Garrod has to run away from the SRA in space because they are militant and evil. They want to deify and use newytpe power to rule. So Garrod joins a random gang of space rebels called Satellicon. Pala Syr seems really fun. Space rebels all die, but nobody really has the time to stop and dwell on that.

Garrod and Tiffa have been slowly improving. Like I said, in the first episode he has this cartoonish over-attraction to a picture of her. But Garrod has become a caring and tender partner to tiffa. Trying to open her up to the crew and world, at the same time, he is mystified and inspired by her powers. I mean we have some love-interests for Garrod introduced in the series that highlight his darker or lighter sides. And I didn't need him to be as devoted to tiffa as he is to make this attraction believable. But it is really working. And when she gets abducted (again) he is sad and it draws some empathy.

In the last 10 episodes we have several *mostly* new factions. Satellicon who isn't warlike. I cant remember why they don't agree with the SRA. The SRA who worships newtypes as the keys to the future. The UNE that wants to use newtypes power to rule. The earth rebels anti-UNE. We don't know much about them either. The Freeden gang gets supported by the resistance groups. By dumping all these characters in at the end, you really needed this exposition to give them any depth with the little time they had left. By this point, Lancerow (Char clone and rival of Jamil from the previous war who gets introduced to a captured Tiffa) and Jamil are sort of fleshed out. They each spend time on screen talking about where they went wrong 15 years ago, and how they can improve.

Okay plot. So Garrod and Pala escape after Satellicon's base and members get destroyed. They show up to the space fleet where The SRA has Tiffa and is gonna use their Gryps laser to destroy the earth. This is the first time we hear about this laser. So Garrod demands her release, and then blows the laser up anyway. He flies away, and then the new UNE space fleet shows up to abduct Pala Tiffa and Garrod.

Oh no! They had a space fleet? Seriously, in a world that was destroyed 15 years ago, they have a space fleet now? These are more world-building consistency issues. The UNE has the fuel and resources to launch fleets into space now? Aren't they only just now reforming, and they fight wars on multiple fronts? How do they have these resources? Isnt the Earth’s population like nothing? Who built their rockets or launchpads or whatever? 

Okay so the New UNE and frost bros kidnap our heroes and take them to earth to talk to bloodman. At the same time, the earth rebels and carrius save the freeden gang from execution when they have also been abducted. Garrod gets out. He gets to the double X. Meets up with the rest of the gang. The resistance just gives them a space ship (the freeden 2?) and sends them into space. The New UNE has launched again and they are gonna destroy the SRA in a massive battle. It starts near the moon. The gang arrives. Garrod threatens to kill everybody, so they stop fighting, and the gang gets a fast pass to the moon. Where DOME and the microwave transmission facility are. The DOME defences let the leaders only in to talk. While the Frost bros break the stalemate and start the war back up.

Final ep. DOME tells the characters what Newtypes are, and what they aren't. Kinda dashing everybody’s hopes except Garrod and Tiffa. Somewhat fulfilled, they all leave. The Frost bros use their weapon to kill the UNE and SRA leaders. Real quick, Garrod fights them. They both get blowed up by a beam explosion, the moon base is destroyed and the war is over. Lancerow and Jamil are presidents now. And they negotiate a peace treaty in an epilogue scene.

-Final Thoughts-

So in the last 10 episodes, Garrod goes into space. Leaves space. Goes to space again. Leaves space for the epilogue scene. Generally, the show greatly improved. After how bad the first 10 eps were, Id go so far as to give this the Most Improved Gundam award.  But 40 episodes instead of the usual 50, really resulted in some plot compression at the end.

If I could fix this show, I would've added the SRA and Satellicon and Pala in very early on. Maybe she joins the team as an emissary or something and that establishes their position early on. And she could be a gundam pilot instead of either Witz or Roabea. We can check in on satellicon through her phonecalls. Make their existence mean something. Additionally I would've made the Freeden bridge member Sara a spy for the SRA or UNE. I needed one more character to do this so that we can at least see one of those factions early on.  

Pala Syr ended up being a really fun new character that gets dumped in right at the end. A welcome addition to freeden gang. Her satellicon resistance group was very underexplored. 

The vultures have completed disappeared from this show. In the first 10 episodes we meet so many different named vultures, but they ended up being 1-shot nobodies as the plot moved away from that. For the better.

Frost Bros end up being a highlight of the show. I like how their motivations really started to come out in the east-asia arc. Maybe they ended up having too much screen time. If we got away from them, then we might've wanted them more. I like their angle that: “we don't belong because we aren't strong enough newtypes to be used, so we will make the world our own whatever the cost.” Definitely really selfish and interesting villains. More so than UNE or SRA leaders by far.

Wow did Witz and Roabea go nowhere.  For a gundam show about gundams. Two of the gundam pilots do almost nothing. Total, they each got about half of 2 episodes each about them. Witz and Toniya  had maybe 0 chemistry but they are allegedly a couple. The scenes with Toniya and Ennil El felt so much more authentic.  It would've been very progressive, I think they could've wrote them as a lesbian couple; but they left that opportunity on the table. It would've made more sense just based on their screentime being enjoyable and kinda mysterious. Is Roabea with Sara or Ennil El now? Didn't he have a revelation that he needs to settle down at some point? His main trait was that he was a womanizer.

The Double X ends up not getting a lot to do. Like it was cool when it debuted. And it had some fun fights in east asia. But ultimately it didn't offer Garrod any new weapons or transformations or abilities. It's the same as the Gundam X. Satellite Cannon. Beam saber. Beam Sword. Shield. Maybe a little faster or bigger or better defense. G falcon fused with it 1 time maybe and wasn't cool. Leopard and Airmaster redesigns are also kinda bland. Mostly just gave them different colors and extra missile pods. Likewise the Versago and Santigo also got redesigns, but it was so subtle that I couldn't tell you when this happened. The black one has a bigger backpack, which conceals a space laser. And the red one’s wings got redesigned so that they gather microwaves for the space laser. The SRA used new cream-colored mobile suits that had a weak spot but were pretty tough. Mentioned once and then never again. I think the MS are pretty lackluster and unimaginative in this series overall. Both Gundams and Grunts.

Do I recommend this show? I don't. Its not a good way to spend 40 epsiodes if you are a casual anime fan. If you need to watch all the gundam, then this show is interesting. It offers a unique discussion on Newtypes. A unique setting. And maybe like 3 strong supporting characters. But there is also inconsistent or 1-dimensional characters. Just decent MS. Poor world building. And a compressed plot that fails, and itsn't ridiculous enough to laugh at.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,94671,public,self,,,After War Gundam X Review,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/kqzett/after_war_gundam_x_review/,,all_ads,6,discussion,83f4319a-5fa5-11e7-8e79-0ec8348f5b38,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I like Kira as a character in Seed but felt that he could've been a better character in Destiny if not for bad story-writing.

The way I see it, Kira should've beaten Shinn during the fight and the argument that I will use as to why he should've won is that he is the Ultimate Coordinator. As the successful result of the Ultimate Coordinator project unlike Canard Pars from the Astray series, Kira pretty much possesses every skill a human could ever wish for, hence Rau Le Creuset's and Rey Za Burrel's  immense hatred towards him. 

This pretty much makes him the ""Superman"" of the Cosmic Era, giving him the ""Jesus"" reputation everyone knows him of.

Now back to my point. As the Ultimate Coordinator, it bugs me why Kira wasn't able to read Shinn's moves despite entering SEED mode. He was able to obliterate Athrun's Savior while not killing him in the process despite not feeling any sort of anger towards him. He just wanted to help Cagalli from negotiating with ORB, which didn't go well until the climax of Seed Destiny.

If Kira can sushi-cut the Savior, then why wasn't he able to do the same with the Impulse ESPECIALLY when the pilot is blinded with rage?

Hell, if Kira won that battle without killing Shinn, it would've led to a better character development for Shinn. Think about the possibility: Kira sushi-cuts the Impulse and captures Shinn's Core Splendor, then brings him in Archangel. Shinn then sees Neo Roanoke aboard and argue about Stella piloting the Destroy, which leads to the Archangel berating Shinn for giving Stella back to Earth Alliance and realize that Shinn is indirectly responsible for the murders by letting Stella go back. Shinn learns about the consequences of war despite his good intentions towards Stella and gets mentored by the Archangel crew instead of being manipulated by Durandal and Rey.

There you have it. Just me explaining about the BS of the fight.

- What were the charges against Kou exactly? Stealing Unit 3, attacking Cima Fleet though they were on the side of the Federation, not withdrawing from the battle space when ordered, or opening fire like a madman at the end? 

- Is there a canon reason for Kou not being a part of Zeta Gundam whether a part of the AEUG or side character? I know it’s really due to Zeta coming out way before and Kou didn’t exist at the time, but I wasn’t sure if there was an explanation. 

- How do the Gundams in 0083 standup to the RX-78-2, the MKII, and the Zeta Gundam? After watching 0083 it would seem they’re on par or arguably better, but that can also come down to how the animation makes them look and move.

He's super agile, intelligent, and exceptionally strong. He *greatly* excels at everything in the academy without a single weakness.

One scene in particular (about 16 minutes into the episode) I found especially confusing; a bully touches his shoulder and Casval simply glares at him. This, for whatever reason, makes the bully scream out in terror and act like he's being electrocuted while unable to let go of Casval's shoulder; as if his hand were stuck. Casval then proceeds to flick him with just one finger and sends the bully (who is larger than Casval) flying several yards away. 

I'm very confused because the show does nothing to explain these super human abilities except in saying that he was ""a good student"" when being raised at home. It would make sense if he was the product of some kind of enhancement experiment, but he is not. I am aware that he is a ""newtype"", but I thought their evolved human aspects simply gave them a ""high degree of focus and spatial awareness"", not the ability to flick someone twice your size and send them flying. Also, according to his wiki, ""Char's Newtype abilities only developed as a result of long term training,"" so while in the academy he shouldn't have even had his full newtype abilities yet, right?

I looked it up to see if maybe I missed something, but from what I can tell, Casval is just a regular spacenoid at this point in the show. So, where did his superpowers come from?

Basically, the 1980s Gundam Live Action was approved, and Zeta had to be retooled into what happened in Real Life's Compilation Movies. ZZ and CCA were fused to one series called X, and Hathaway's Flash was a series in 1989 instead of OTL 2020s movie.

F91 is a full series, probably incorporating Crossbone. Victory is as it is in real life. No G-Gundam and thus the Gundam Polka project is used instead; basically Gundam Age in 1994 but better. Gundam Wing does lack the yaoi fangirls. Turn-A is as in real life, and attempts to reboot the franchise failed (eliminating Unicorn and Gundam Seed) and Gundam 00 got only one season.

* The ""core gundam experience"" does not have to be the universal century, any AU can be someone's core experience with gundam, and they do not require all the baggage.
* It frontloads newbies with hundreds of episodes of old as f\*ck anime, meaning it will take forever for them to get to the newer and harder hitting stuff (even stuff from the 90's would take so long to get to)
* most people do not go into Gundam looking to see all 40 years worth of anime, they probably go in with one show in particular in mind and will often go right back out when they are done with that. Not everyone stays.

I have loved the designs of Gundams since I first saw them as a kid. I even had a couple scale figures that I played with more than anything else I had! 
I also play the Gunpla game from Google play store daily, so it's pretty crazy for me to say that I have never seen a single episode, not even seen or heard the intro. But its time for me to learn the story arcs and characters.

I would like to know the best way to enjoy all of the Gundam content from 1979-current. There's alternate story arcs, so I'm wondering if there's an ""Original Storyline"" I should follow, or one that the elitists/gatekeepers accept as a main timeline? (No offense btw, I get like that about cars)
And another thing- should I watch the alternate timelines as they were released, or as they fit ""the best"" into the main storyline (if at all)? 
I'm sure there's differences in the Japanese and US releases also. I enjoy listening in both languages, so that isn't a factor, just the story. Unless there are missing episodes or something in the US release, or vice versa, where I can ""fill in the blanks"" with the other country's release? 

Probably seems like a mundane question, but maybe it will spark some deep conversation/lore/theory... or maybe not lol

Kinda depressing actually lol partly due to the soundtrack. I'll just put in a few of my speculations of the ending.

&gt;!1. Coming home to Vicinity. Diana and Kihel were talking about switching for good. House was rebuilt.!&lt;

&gt;!2. Bruno and Jacop ran a theatre while waiting for the Willgem to be fixed/mod. The mech engineer lady we have seen before was selling cotton candy beside them. Kids are idolizing Turn A now (in contrast with his initial depiction as the White Devil), which makes me believe that Turn A actually has his own AI conscious which ultimately decided to die together with X and Gym in a cocoon for good. The last close up shot showing his face while waiting for Loran to escape before fully enclosing the cocoon, was kinda sentimental (might just be my imagination lel). Later on in the epilogue we can see flowers(?) started growing out from the cocoon with silk-like lines flowing all around, and Gym's little cocoon standing beside lol.!&lt;

&gt;!3. First Winter. Loran is leaving with Dianna. We can see Dianna's hair ring as her indication here. A goodbye kiss.!&lt;

&gt;!4. Bruno and Jacop made it into the Royal Guards team. Poe is missing here. We can see Loran's childhood friends have decided to stay on Earth to live the real fishermen's life. Sochie mentioning Video Phone, Ames saying they will visit again, ""Ameria to Moon Air"" all indicating that they will keep in touch, with Laura(Willgem) as a transport vehicle. Sochie's not so alone anymore from this perspective. !&lt;

&gt;!5. Dianna's ring (most probably from Will Game). Red Team's back to moon. Joseph and Fran living the life with their kids. Then we see POE (I didn't realize this until someone pointed it out) with Papa Sid going around, most probably searching for another mountain cycle.!&lt;

&gt;!6. Keith's making it big. Grandma's back! Ayyyyyy. Kihel's taking over Dianna's role. Moon boi is going ""steady"" with Miashei.!&lt;

&gt;!7. Sochie threw the fish away, further indicating Loran's not coming back anymore. Guin and Merrybell  in exile.!&lt;

&gt;!8. Swan scene. Classic. The cocoon scene I mentioned. Dianna living her life. Now this is the part I feel different. I don't think Dianna is dying soon. Her mentioning about the hibernation taking a toll was during the moon palace riot. Dianna was rushing towards the Winter Palace with Kihel and Harry, ON FOOT. Dianna ran out of breath quickly. She was just stating that no matter how much hibernation was able to keep her from aging, her body technically was still older and has weaker stamina. It doesn't not indicate that her body system is failing. It's the same thing as you stop jogging for a few months and find yourselves getting tired like hell when you finally went for a run. She is weak, that's all. She just stated that she wishes to live her life out on Earth, it's not the same as ""I'm dying soon"". It just meant that she would like to retire and live on Earth. It is also a common practice/precaution to walk in snow with a walking stick due to slippery surfaces, considering Dianna being weak. Loran, being a loyal fanboy servant as he is, decided to cast away his own personal love life with Sochie, and serves Dianna to the very end. +1 for Dianna, 0 for Sochie.!&lt; oof. Life moves on. Whatever happens, happens.

Lastly, that ending soundtrack. Gave it a Studio Ghibli Disney Pixar finishing touch. Subarashi! All hail Yoko Kanno!

* The stuff with Lockon's twin brother...I mean it was kinda strange, but I was able to accept it. 
* Setsuna and the crew continued to be badasses.
* I really loved where they took Saji and Louise's story. I thought that part of the show was fantastic. And there were a lot of emotionally resonating moments involving all characters.

The story shares some similarities with the old gundam X , but at the same time manages to be so different from other installement in the franchise . The fights are way more brutal and physical due to the power levels of the mechs in this show being balanced . I didnt like the artstyle that much , some characters looked weird (example : mika) , but the animation was top tier although i dont think its the best looking gundam as some claim . I didnt find myself invested in the Tekkadan for some reason , maybe their motives or the characters themselves were uninteresting for me . Gallarhorn as an organization is cool , i like their uniforms , crank reminds me of vatsfeld from seed , and Mc guiliss fareed is my fav character in the show , not only he is voiced by the va of one of my favourites villain of all time makshima shougo , he also has this mysterious mastermind vibe to him and i love it . Opening 1 is an absolute classic and i liked ed2 as well . 
To conclude its not the best first season out there but it was an enjoyable watch 7/10

In a way, I sorta agree, but not entirely. I think to excuse Gundam as a glorification of war entirely is doing the franchise and its stories a disservice because it also shows characters struggles and the horrible shit that happens in war.

I do not think any love interest in the entire franchise gets worse treatment.  


Think of how much it sucks to be Emily, she spends most of the first arc (with what little screentime and agency she gets) trying to take Flit off of the path that she fears he will go down, that he will become a different person because of fighting in this war. And while she does end up marrying him her fears are absolutely spot on because that is exactly what happened. Flit never left that teenage battlefield, at least not mentally. Hatred takes hold of his heart due to his love for another girl, a love probably stronger than he feels for Emily even after marrying her and having children.  


Does Emily ever get to speak up about this? NO, She doesn't, she doesn't do ANYTHING, the series doesn't let her do anything. Why didn't she try (harder) to dissuade her son from joining the military? She had seen what war did to her husband and wouldn't she want to keep it from happening to her son at all costs?  


HER SON WAS MIA PRESUMED DEAD FOR 13 YEARS! You would think she would try at all costs to stop her husband from dragging their grandson into this war of his after watching what it did to him and how it claimed their son. Upon seeing Flit attempt to train Kio on the simulator she should have packed up her things and took their daughter, their grandson and his mother and left while leaving a note saying ""If you want to save the people you love so badly stop sending them to die in your war"" Kio of course wouldn't have sat idly by but Emily should have tried to stop Flit.  


Gundam Age did not treat love interests well, mostly not really letting them do anything. Emily really is a tragic figure but the show had no interest in it. Romary should have been a more active force seeing as how she absolutely wanted to threesome with Asemu and Zehart, but her character goes nowhere. Kio's love interest (whatever her name was) served no narrative purpose whatsoever and because of that did literally nothing. Even Yurin only served as a plot device to make Flit hate the Vagan but was given next to no screentime so that was all she ever got to be rather than an actual character.

Yes, this is a complaint.  


Gundam Unicorn is my favorite series in this franchise. I absolutely love how it takes the two most interesting things in the UC universe, newtypes and perpetual conflict, and deals with them. However I cannot overlook the most glaring flaw of the series. And that is that the characters are simply not that good. Are they effective? Yes, our primary cast of characters very effectively convey the different viewpoints of what to do with Laplace's box and where the future should go, but the issue is that we are not given too much outside of that. Who is Banagher outside of the boy following in the footsteps of his father's ideals? Who is Mineva outside of being a mostly powerless figurehead? Who is Riddhe? Marida, etc. Who are these people personally? Unicorn does not let up on the breaks much so the characters are not given much time to develop personally. What saves them from being total shite is again that while their personalities can be a bit vague at least all the characters are DISTINCT from one another, we know who believes in what ideology and who each character represents. Unicorn would have been near perfect if it had slowed down and removed a few inches of that stick it has up it's \*\*\*, old UC gundam shows had plenty of goofiness to go around but Unicorn is just so dead serious (the lack of levity is the second worst thing about the show).

I know there are some people who like or love the design of the Turn A, but I need to say this for those that arent exactly a fan of it, because its not their fault, its in the poor design of the head itself.

The problem with the design is not the MS as a whole, but 95% because of the head. Yes, I know thats what makes it unique but the problem is that from a design point of view, the head is not exactly speaking the same language as the rest of the body and weapons. The way that its detailed with a mohawk, a V-fin that has two-plane curvature (curving upwards and backwards), and a sparsely detailed dome for a head is pretty out of place as everything else is stylized heavily with straight lines and single-plane curves. Look at the shield, it has curves and an amount of detail consistent with the other parts which makes it look great and blends well with rest of the MS, unlike the head.

You dont see as many people complaining about the SUMO and Turn X and its not because theyre less known, but because those look aesthetically pleasing to the eyes as you see them. The designs of both, from head to toe, are consistent and blend very well despite elements of assymetry. In psychology, symmetrical designs are perceived more beautifully than assymetrical designs. The fact that a good portion of people dont like the Turn A but like the Turn X shows us that there is a problem in the design of the Turn A that is deeper than just simply not liking the design itself.

To get a better picture of what Im saying, look at the Zeta Zaku, they both are almost the same beat-for-beat in styling and design language, even the coloring is 70% same. This isnt helped by the fact that the head is much larger proportionally to the rest of the body compared to other gundams (and even the Turn X) but also very closely resembles Zaku proportions, which articificially draws attention to those out of place design elements. Speaking of Zaku, the head itself definitely looks like a Zaku made to look like a Gundam, which does not give the right message especially to the established audience of Gundam. What separates these two is that the Zeta Zaku was a one-off, while the Turn A is a design that would not be changing throughout the story, so youre stuck with it either way.

A much better design that is consistent with the rest of the MS is the Shin Turn A, which has a head that speaks the same design language and understands the core principles of its design, as literally the only thing different on it is the head (yes I know the 0 Raiser docks and it has different colors slightly but u get the point). Im not saying that the Shin shouldve been the design of Turn A the whole time. What Im saying is that the head is the critical failure that breaks what couldve been a truly great design, so yes, the design has real tangible flaws centered on the head itself. Its aesthetically controversial because many people dont like it for a REAL reason, not because it is different or unique.

Lastly, saying that it looks unique and the mustache is what makes it great is... frankly, kinda stupid and self-defeating. The mustache is only part of the design, which is why the complete design has to be taken into account and that the head itself does not define the rest of the Gundam. Also, radical changes to the design have not stopped people from liking it. Good examples are 00 and IBO where people love the look of those not simply because theyre a departure from the usual Gundam, but because they were consistent and were well thought of beforehand (Hekija still looks quite bad tho). Remember when people didnt like Barbatos and said it wasnt a Gundam?

Im very thankful that you spend your time reading this post.

 Therefore im very grateful. So as the title said, Im going to introduce to you guys about a gundam game that truly underrated.

 It was MSGO or Mobile Suit Gundam Online. So what is this game about you may ask? Well this game is Third Person Shooter 52 vs 52 in large scale battle. Even though being a release in japan only, this game doesn't have any sort of region lock and all you need to do is make a japanese region bandai account. 

For the suits it have Universal Century suits consisting of OG gundam, Blue Destiny, Unicorn, sentinal and many more. And also the game has a new suits from gundam victory series and also phantom gundam from crossbone series.

For those who prefer other universe setting, we have seed, 00, age and currently IBO suits.

The way to get a suits is through gacha but you can also get it through pilot pass and also a shop. Pilot pass is basically a battle pass.

Currently an event is running right now which celebrate 8th anniversary of the game. So if you join right now you can get both BD2 and BD3 for free in the pilot pass. And you can also roll the anniversary gacha with the daily login ticket you get.

The game is consist of two faction which is Order and Rebel. Each faction have their own specific suit as example for Kimaris it was an Order suit due to Gjallarhorn and Barbatos being in Rebel due to being a Tekkadan. Right now they are currently a gacha  running that can bait you Freedom Gundam for Order and 00 for Rebel.

That all for my introduction. I hope that you will try this game. If you are lost or anything feel free to visit the discord channel. Thank you for reading this.

While gundam wing was the first series I've seen, in the aftermath, I never thought that the gundam designs were that great for being a universal gorillia fighting unit.

The wing, while being powefull, has limited ammo capacity and mid range capabilities. Also I find the transformation a bit lackluster.

The zeta plus has similar capabilities, yet has a bit more rounded arsenal. While not as powerful as the buster rifle, a smart gun would be more efficient against a higher number of enemies, due to higher fighting capabilities.

Sandrock is a gundam with only heat shovels. It has not even beam weaponry.

I believe the duel would be more then capable enough to fulfill the roles the sandrock has. Especially with the assault shroud.

The deathscythe is also just a melee unit. I believe a configuration like the exia or blitz would work similarly, just without a gun drive.

The heavy arms actually works for me as a design. Maybe needs a bit of work on the close quarter combat side but is okay.

The shenlong, well I got nothing on that one...

ZZ
Seed Destiny
00 2nd Season/0083
BFT/Divers

Despite the more relaxed pace, this run was certainly significantly worse than my previous run (Zeta, Turn A, Seed, 00/BF), which is mostly what I expected.

I was warned that ZZ was a bit goofy, but particularly as a direct sequel to Zeta and with the context of where everything ends up in Unicorn, I guess I still wasn't expecting a full on comedy. I think it maybe would have been fine to try this angle if the series was at least tonally committed to being light-hearted. The first half has characters cheating death with slapstick antics while the ending segments have characters randomly dying to seemingly minor injuries to the point where it's hard to accept that characters themselves actually believe their deaths.

I was also warned about Destiny but honestly... I kinda liked it. I'll fully admit it has a SUPER rough start, but once I realized the whole point of the show was to frame Shinn as a reflection of Kira it actually helped me appreciate Kira as a character. That said it's a rather bloated series and I fully understand why opinions on it are so mixed.

Build Fighter Try was interesting. The change to a team format was definitely a great call as it helps sell the cool factor and make each fight feel important. The problem is that the series deliberately lacks ""living Gundam wiki"" character which was essential to selling the relevance of each mech in the original Build Fighters series. At least as someone who is largely a Gundam casual, my capacity to appreciate the robots was significantly diminished by the lack of this archetype. I was glad to see this character type return in Build Divers.

The 2nd half of 00 is a bit weaker than I was expecting. Although I preferred Lyle Dylandy, I wasn't thrilled about the team rebuilding arc... or the immediate reuse of the orbital cannon... or Marina Ismail's attempt to turn things into Macross... or the way they just kinda ended various plot threads with no real payoff. Still the 2nd half was only weak in comparison to the strength of the first half, and ultimately, still very good.

The real standout was 0083. This thing was a masterpiece in its own right but an absolutely essential piece of the greater UC puzzle. I went in assuming it was just a side story but was absolutely delighted when I realized it was setting the stage for Zeta and bridging the gap.

At that point Gundam was just over 10 years old and already had 150 Television episodes,4 movies, and a direct to video miniseries. This may not seem daunting to an avid anime viewer but it is a huge turn off to general audiences who otherwise may be interested in buying Gunpla. The solution Bandai and Sunrise came up with was to ditch all that baggage and start fresh. New viewers would not need to know what an amuro a char or a zeon was, they wouldn't need to know 10 years worth of fictional politics about space nazi-wanabes or jerka\*\* earth politicians. They could jump right into the new stuff and not have to worry. Fans of the old stuff would still get their OVA's but as far as the creators were concerned the storyline was done and it was time for a new one. This is why it says ""This is only the beginning"" at the end of F91. Looking at F91 they absolutely succeeded in disconnecting it from the previous stuff. Change the calandar to something other than UC and remove the Jegans and congratulations you have just created the first Gundam AU.  


Of course things did not pan out the way Bandai or Sunrise hoped. F91 had to be changed from a 50 episode series to a movie. It's figures were disappointing, so disappointing in fact that they did the exact same thing with Victory Gundam in 1993, setting it so far down the timeline (30 years again) so that it would have nothing to do with F91 and new viewers could jump on. Really the only connection to F91 is again the calendar and additionally the mention of SRNI (the ones who built the F91 and the victorys). Victory also flopped hard, so much so that 27 years later we have not seen a 50 episode UC series and probably never will. And that is because the first proper AUs, Mobile Fighter G Gundam and Mobile Suit Gundam Wing absolutely knocked it out of the park and really saved the franchise from ending right in the mid nineties with actually good gunpla sales. And in the 25 years since AU's have repeatedly shown to be the big money makers.  


The late UC since has gotten some thread binding it together, most notably crossbone which ties F91 to Victory. Side stories also tie the early and late UC together, most notably in the appearance of an old man with an old gundam. But still it's two primary works really exist for the most part in complete vaccums, almost like prototypes to the business model the franchise would take going forward.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,93817,public,self,,,Late UC is basically the first AU,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/kjx9a3/late_uc_is_basically_the_first_au/,,all_ads,6,discussion,83f4319a-5fa5-11e7-8e79-0ec8348f5b38,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Still shooting gatlings, Duo wasn't amused.
Heero went to fight Wufei, still in his Gundam,
A stray missile from Trowa lets Heero play possum.

With some guy named Wind making MO-III scattered.
Barton escaped, gone in a flash,
Zechs headed to Earth, ready to slash.

Wufei sucks, he's such a bell-end.
Heero won't fight, his mind is a fog,

Heero's knocked on his ass, his head is straight rattled.

TL;DR: If F91 is where the world ends up after Unicorn that is really f\*cking lame.  


If I recall correctly there is a line in F91 that explains what a Newtype is. Something along the lines of ""They are ace pilots maybe even have weird abilities."" This is really the only explanation the movie gives of what a newtype is, probably in no small part due to the fact that the movie does not have time to explain and it is a concise enough explanation for people going into the movie to know what a newtype is. But if we take this exclusively in universe, removing any reference to the fact that this is in fact a movie, it goes to show that people living in UC 123 seem to have forgotten all about the teachings of Zeon Deikun. This makes sense given in supplementary material apparently the Republic of Zeon was dissolved and rejoined the Earth Federation in UC 100. The last conflict with Zeon had been 30 years ago and time just went on.  


Let us rewind those 30 years to another conversation that took place in UC 96 at the begining of Gundam Unicorn. The crew of the spaceship Garencieres were meeting in secret with the Vist Foundation to receive Laplace's box for Neo Zeon, or that was what they thought. All they were being given was the key. Obviously displeased they question the head of the foundation, Cardeas, and they have a short conversation before being interrupted. Anyways, during the conversation it is brought up that someone when asked what a newtype was answers by saying ""ace pilot with weird powers"" which is pointed out to be completely devoid of almost everything Zeon Deikun preached in his Newtype theory, at least any of the points that actually mattered. And as we learn through the series this is a very deliberate and malicious action by the Earth Federation to destroy zeonism. The plan has two parts, the first is the destruction of Newtype adversaries with the Unicorn Gundam, a machine so powerful it can allow an amateur pilot (with only a little mobile suit experience) to go toe to toe with the likes of Full Frontal, a powerful cyber newtype who is like if Char Aznable actually lived up to his hype. The other part of the plan is to dissolve the Republic of Zeon in UC 100. It is both of these things that cause Cardeas Vist to contact Neo Zeon and offer them Laplace's box, setting the events of Gundam Unicorn in motion.  


So what is the problem here? It sounds like the story lines up and UC 96 and UC 123 are connected, right? The problem is that Gundam Unicorn's events happen. By the end of Unicorn and Narrative we see Mineva Lao Zabi step up to become an actual leader of a Zeon faction, perhaps the first ever Zeon leader who was not an evil supervillain. She, Banagher, and the rest of her faction are dedicated to sticking up for the spacenoids and reminding people that space magic exists, this time through more progressive means rather than the brutality of Zeon's previous leaders. Where this doesn't match up with F91 is that Mineva had been a dropped character for 20 years. Her last real mention before unicorn was a very brief mention of how the Mineva we see at the end of ZZ was a body double, she finally made a proper reemergence in Unicorn. F91 was not made with the idea that Mineva would be doing things in UC 96-97, it pretty much assumed that the last zeon war was in UC 93 as seen in CCA and that after that Zeon just rolled over and died, very much the opposite of what we are seeing happen in Unicorn and Narrative. So if we are to believe that Unicorn leads into F91, we have to make the assumption that Mineva and banagher's actions meant jack s\*it which I can only describe as REALLY F\*CKING LAME!  


The most common answer i see people giving for how Unicorn DOES lead into F91 is that Unicorn is a way to explain that the federation got all spooked about CCA's deus ex machina ending that saved them and that's why there are no psyco frame mobile suits in UC 123. I don't like this explanation because it kinda pushes everything Unicorn's story was about to the side in order to say ""this is why mobile suits are no longer controlled by the pilot's mind and no longer glows."" It is not made better by the fact that F91's titular mobile suit is piloted in part by the pilots using their mind and it also glows (yellow instead of green.)",True,True,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,93715,public,spoiler,,,Unicorn (and Narrative) do not lead into F91 and the late UC,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/kiskme/unicorn_and_narrative_do_not_lead_into_f91_and/,,all_ads,6,discussion,83f4319a-5fa5-11e7-8e79-0ec8348f5b38,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Feddie designs I find beautiful.

1. RGM-89 Jegan. It has an appealing design to me as I find it's curved silhouette nice to look at when you compare it to it's blocky GM forebears. Moreover, it bears the most distinct appearance of the RGM series, especially when you place it near to it's Late UC successors. The Jegan makes the Heavygun,  Hardygun, Jamesgun and Javelin look like generics when placed side by side.
2. RGZ-95C ReZEL Commander Type. I find it quite sleek looking when compared to it's RGZ-95 counterpart, especially in Waverider mode.

Ugly Feddie designs (in my opinion):

1. Jegan Escort Type: There is something aesthetically off about placing that bump helmet on top of a mobile suit.
2. FD-03 Gustav Karl (Unicorn version): Too Zeon-like in terms of bulk and boy, that head design looks like the designer had trouble deciding between a GM style head and a Gundam type head, then it was hit by the proverbial ugly stick.
3. NRX-055 Baund Doc: What the hell I am looking at!? It looks like it is wearing a tutu!

Zeek designs I find beautiful.

1. MS-14 Gelgoog and variants: The Gelgoog is beautiful, no ifs or buts in my opinion. None of those exposed power pipes and just look at those curves and that sensor fin at the back of it's head . It is basically a Zaku High Mobility Type if it was exposed to the Well of Eternity and evolved into a superior form.
2. MS-09B Dom and MS-09R Rick Dom: Those curves make it nice to look at for the same reason as the Gelgoog. In addition, there is a certain grace to a Dom's movements when it is hovering.

Ugly Zeek designs (in my opinion):

1. MS-06FZ Zaku II Kai: The body design is fine, but the snout is a tad too long. Especially with that RE 100 kit. 
2.  MS-17 Galbaldy: Yes, I get it is supposed to be a Gyan successor that was retrofitted with Gelgoog parts, still, that head looks like it was beaten with the ugly stick.
3. : AMA-01X Jamru Fin: Oh god, I get this was a half baked prototype, but boy it looks like a MS and a Big Zam collided together with the ugly tree and the parts remaining were assembled into this mishmash.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,93634,public,self,,,My opinion on the most beautiful (and ugly) Federation and Zeon Mobile Suit designs.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/khyd1g/my_opinion_on_the_most_beautiful_and_ugly/,,all_ads,6,news,4deca144-5eba-11e8-87bd-0e550d339522,Probably Bullshit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Note: this is sparked by an argument I had with my friend about this subject)


1) evidence not based on the barbatos: the gusion rebake and the ferocity were incredibly strong throughout the show, as they should be, although both forms didn't get enough attention. The gusion does not take very much damage throughout the series, when it uses ranged weapons. Think about the graze ritters, how he barely sustained any significant damage throughout the fight because he stayed back and worked off artillery. This shows how effective ranged combat is in a world of physical combat.

Baels high mobility is used incredibly effectively before it's fight with the kimaris vidar. The fight between them only becomes fair once the bael engages and maintains a close distance with the kimaris vidar, as well as the fact that mcgillis was intentionally provoking gaelio.



2) barbatos/mikazuki's fighting style: in every form of barbatos, especially the rex, mikazuki relies heavily on rushing the enemy before they get a chance to react, and bonking them to death. One of the struggles mikazuki faces is fighting the gusion. He ends up switching his weapon, and fighting style, to go for the gaps in the joints. Mikazuki doesn't face many shielded/heavily armoured enemies, and so we never see his fighting style change back to this. Mikazuki also stops his use of the katana not too much later, so for this theoretical, we can abandon that.



3)alaya vijnana: especially when mikazuki turns of the limiters his reaction time and connection to the ms became significantly better. I personally would compared this to a newtype and their reaction times. 


4) strategy: mikazuki is essentially useless when it comes to strategy, he always requires outside help in the form of someone like orga. 

5) So how could mikazuki be beaten? If you believe that beam weapons can cut through nano laminate, which is very unlikey, then it would be a very simple slice in half and the barbatos is down, but if we are being more realistic, beam weapons could damage joints, so elbows, knees and calfs would be weak points. This is unlikely, obviously.


The way mikazuki dies is from the dainsleifs, which are really just rail guns. Something like the atlas theoretically could take the barbatos down. We also know that even if the armour is not pierced, shock from high power weapons can kill, so bazookas from most MS could also possibly do the trick in quick one shot kill

Third is mikazukis lack of anti armour abilities. Obviously only in space, the full armour gundam from thunderbolt would have a good chance, having high mobility, high defense,and high firepower, it could most likely outlast the barbatos and break down it's armour slowly.

Ranged superiority is also another factor, small shots picking away at the barbatos. Ground gundam is a good contender, with a long ranged powerful rifle, and the gundam hammer if the barbie gets too close. 

Finally is a big one: aerial superiority. Any gundam that has flight capabilities and ranged weapons mikazuki would not have very much opportunity to take many shots 


Overall verdict: the barbatos is a melee combat specified unit that would become significantly better if it had a different pilot, a shield, and flight capabilities. It is about the level of combat strength (imo) of a high mobility zaku or a ground gundam.

I just finished Mobile Suit Gundam the other day and am looking to tear through the rest of the UC timeline.

So what are you hoping to get from the new AU? Something out there and weird like G (YuYuHakusho/Dragon ball meets Gundam), Turn A (Tomino being happy Tomino), IBO (Mafia rags to riches story meets Gundam), or do you want to see an AU that is basically a remake of UC, like X, Seed and AGE (not saying them being a remake is bad, I love X and Seed).

So is there anything you hope they will try? I would personally like to see a medieval Gundam show, sort of like Escaflowne, with Gundams and Zaku's looking like knights, and having epic castle sieges and sword fights. I also wouldn't mind a third rehash of Wing, with four pretty boys taking on whatever the current political issue is (Wing was 90's optimism and idealism, 00 was same thing but post 9/11 war on terror thing). Also, this is the most fanservie-y, but an ''Into the Gundamverse'', where established mc's from previous Gundam shows, have a big crossover, would be fun, if a little bit on the nose.

I figured that I would put them to you kind folk, and see if any of y’all might be able to lend me some answers. 

•Who was originally supposed to pilot the Unicorn Gundam?

•What functional purpose do Gundams’ V-Fins serve?

•When Banagher is trying to stop Loni Garvey in the Shamblo from further attacking Torrington, who do the purple hands belong to that push him back? Are they hers?

•Is Urdr Hunt EVER coming out?

•Does anyone else think that it seems like Angelo Sauper’s Rozen Zulu is like...way more powerful than the Sinanju, with those insane scatter cannon/energy absorption shield things? And that it’s odd that FF wouldn’t be piloting the more powerful machine?

•Is there any explanation for the visual upgrades the 5 Wing boys’ Gundams got between the show and Endless Waltz, or is it just kind of a wink, pretend they were like that all along kinda thing?

•Speaking of EW, is there any explanation for where the Tallgeese III came from?

•Is Advance of Zeta really mostly just a short story? I keep hearing about a manga but I haven’t been able to find anything about it, aside from some concept art that’s labelled as being from it.

That’s all that I have for the time being, although I’m sure I’ll come up with some more before I finish my rewatch of IBO.

I think that’s awesome, but I’m just wondering, for the sake it it really, if anyone has a certain preference for any English, or Japanese/Subtitled versions of any of the **’GUNDAM’** series out there.

It is already confirmed that the armor can deflect beams. No reason why nanolaminate armor cannot deflect Colony Laser, maybe it'll get pushed away from the shear force but none of the laser will harm the armor. Imagine superman hit by an asteroid, he will be pushed back but he won't get hurt.

A laser is a laser regardless of what is powering the light source. Even a free electron laser dumps high speed electrons into a sacrificial brick of Tungsten carbide so that only photons hit the focusing lense. A laser doesn't have a temperature, only a frequency. The photon bombardment against an absorbent surface at light speed is what generates the heat. If the surface is reflective, then the photons simply change direction without heating up the reflective surface. An industrial CNC cutting laser can't cut sheet metal polished to a mirror finish. You can't even mark a highly polished part with an engraving laser. The volume of photons impacting a given surface area is what determines its intensity. A refractive surface dissipates the beam and spreads it across a wider surface area decreasing its intensity. Even a thin coat of oil will refract an industrial or engraving laser enough to prevent it from cutting into the material. 

In short, a laser will pass through a clear surface and reflect off of a shiny surface without causing any damage. Even if the nanolaminate paint only refracted the beam; it would still take a while to heat up the paint and the metal behind it. The way it's illustrated in the show, the coating is completely reflective. So any mobilesuit with nanolaminate coating on it would theoretically be able to fly right through the beam of the colony laser without being damaged. The beam also doesn't last very long, so really they could probably just sit there through the duration of exposure without any problem. It's just photons reflecting off of a shiny surface.

I tend to prefer English dubs, as they're easier to follow. That is not to say I will not watch sub-only series (I already have for several). I will watch every one eventually. For each option listed, assume it includes OVA/ONA/movies as well, as one complete package.

SD series are omitted, but if I haven't listed a series as an option you can assume I have already seen it. Still, please ask questions as necessary, as I greatly appreciate the community's feedback.

My top 5 series (most watched or rewatched over this year):

1. Turn-A Gundam

2. G Gundam Mobile Fighter

3. Gundam The Origin

4. Gundam Unicorn

5. 0083 Stardust Memory

IBO and Thunderbolt would be within my top 10. I didn't really like Wing as much as I remembered as a kid, when I rewatched it last year. I remember not liking Seed when it originally aired, but I don't remember why. For several of the remaining series, I find their mecha designs are somewhat generic from a cursory view (Seed and 00). If Gundam X had any sort of dub I would have already watched it.

I have seen Gundam Build Fighters, but I'm still conflicted as to whether or not I liked it overall. It is literally the most trope-ridden Gundam show I've ever seen; I realize that's probably part of the appeal. I'm still not sure if it was really intended for kids or not, given some of the content and references. I wanted to include Build Fighters Try and Build Divers/Re:Rise, but the poll ran out of spaces. I watched one episode of Try and didn't really want to continue it.

If you're interested, here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUQkw2aMRU

I remember not liking it when I first watched it, but after rewatching it, I see its lost potential and was quickly able to pinpoint most of the issues.

The overall issue isn't so much that the plot or movie as a whole is neccesarily bad, but that it doesn't leave much impact compared to other Gundam stories. There isn't much of anything
that stands out as particularly memorable, be it plot points, characters, fights, or mobile suit designs. It's pretty bland, but has bits of greatness hidden throughout.
If it had been given 15-20 more minutes and maybe one more draft of writing, it could've been great.

The Good: 

Details of the carnage of war and the animation

The animation is high quality here, Sunrise operating at peak performance, managing to greatly outshine their previous Gundam movie, Char's Revenge in shear animation quality.
Most of this high quality animation is used to capture the fine details of the carnage of war. The best bit of this is of course, the scene where a stray shell from a mobile suit battle
strikes a mother carrying her baby in the head and she DIES. Absolutely horrific and yet delightful to see, as it feels so real.

Cosmo Babylonia vs. Earth Federation Thematically

This was probably the first Gundam story to make a successful attempt at portraying both sides of the central conflict as morally gray with no clear good guys vs bad guys, (albeit with one
clear bad guy amongst the guys who don't have the Gundam aka ""bad guys"" in a thousand quotes) an idea that would become a common theme in later seasons to varying degrees, and imo is 
perfected in Thunderbolt. The Federation is shown as having grown lazy and cowardly, with most of their troops either far too willing to sacrifice civilians to save themselves (epitomized
in the comically over the top but nonetheless effective scene where an officer orders his squad to use children as human shields to get past the enemy.), fighting recklessly
in a manner that causes more collateral damage to the colony they are trying to protect, or see employing
child soldiers as no big deal. (I think this is the fault of all those increasingly young protagonists from previous seasons. Thanks to Judah, Amuro and Camille, now everyone sees kids as 
potential Newtype sooper-soldiers. I kind of wish this reasoning was stated up front to make it seem a little less desperate and out of left field when they do this with almost nobody 
challenging it in both this movie and Victory Gundam.) The idea is that because the Federation is a ""true democracy"" (I assume they mean a direct democracy, but even that would
likely have Senators and a President to operate the legislature.) with no single leader or figurehead to draw loyalty of the people and soldiers to. Although they have their freedom, 
their society is fickle and lacking in solid morals. This is contrasted by Cosmo Babylonia, an autocracy that bills itself as heavily honorable. They draw their power from absolute 
loyalty to their figureheads, the Ronah family. The problem with this sort of rule by the elite of course is, much like trickle down economics, it only works under the assumption that the 
people at the top have the greater good in mind and prioritize peoples' well-being over their own gain. If the people at the top of the hierarchy are greedy psychopaths ruled by their own 
short-sighted personal desires (see Gihren Zabi, Iron Mask, Char in Char's Revenge), the only people who benefit are those on top. It's a classic economic class conflict. Despite some 
decent attempts to use the mobile suits as a subtle way of communicating this to the knowledgeable fan (The Federation use outdated suits such as Jegans and barely functional literal 
museum exhibits early on while the Vanguard and Cosmo Babylonia use new model mobile suits, showing the difference in resources) they never go all the way with it. The Federation 
naturally gets shiny new suits halfway through because Bandai needs more toy money, baby, and never touches the relics again. Some guerilla warfare featuring scrapped together suits 
reminescent of ZZ Gundam's Zeta Zaku or Crossbone's ""mixing build"" suits would've be lovely, especially if at least one of the protagonists was portrayed as a street rat similar to Judah 
from ZZ Gundam or maybe a scrapyard worker. Really go for that morally gray class warfare angle.

Cecily Fairchild

Cecily Fairchild is a pretty good character. She's willing to sacrifice her own freedom and ideals in the hopes of helping protect her homeland and friends and sofiten the blow of the 
Cosmo Babylonia occupation. She begrudgingly accepts their nomination of her as their lead figurehead in the hopes that the position will allow her a little say in what they do with her 
homeland.  She's also one of the first female protagonists in Gundam who isn't defined primarily by being a woman and/or her relationship with a male character. (Almost every other female 
exists to be X's love interest or have a crush on X that goes tragically unnoticed before dying.) Some arguments can be made for Roux Louka from ZZ as a strong independent female, and 
perhaps Sayla/Artesia, even though both of those end up being to some degree love interest characters, but regardless, Cecily is an interesting character. 

Rafflesia

This is just me probably, but I kind of like the design of Rafflesia. I wouldnt call it iconic or amazingly memorable, but as a true 'Murican who is a fan of big, dumb, bulky Mobile Armors
 like Big Zam, I kind of like it myself, this big red space jellyfish with its sawblade tentacles. Somewhere between bulky and graceful lies Rafflesia.

The Bad:

Iron Mask

Iron Mask is just a terrible antagonist. As cool as his mask is, he is basically scuffed Darth Vader. His goals are very murky, especially towards the end, and he is a walking contradiction.
Perhaps it supposed to be intentional, but this is highlighted by the scene where he tells his estranged wife that he wears his mask so he can seperate emotion from his duties. 
(I don't know how that mask will help you with that, but sure buddy, you tell yourself that.) Immediately after this, the man who cucked him drops dead, presumably from something Iron Mask
 did that they drew little to no attention to (Maybe he used the Force to stop his heart, IDK.)in an act that I can only see as an emotional act of revenge, because there was no reason 
for him to need to kill that man for his duties. (Was that whole exchange a convoluted way of saying that this one action was personal, but everything else he does is pure business?)
The real issue though is that without properly establishing that the Earth Sphere is in need of a population purge, Iron Mask decides that he needs to enact one, with drones rather than 
Gundam trope #3, using a colony drop as a space-age analog for WMDs because this was made in the same country that got Hiroshima'ed and Nagasaki'ed, in case you forgot.
This comes out of nowhere, has very little setup (outside of a speech about how the elites have migrated back to Earth, which still doesn't really establish that there's a population
control problem of any sort (I guess there hasnt been a colony drop in a while, but that's pretty weak justification for committing a mass murder. It just makes Iron Mask feel like 
a total psychopath who wants to massacre civilians because lol why not rather than a morally gray villain to line up with the rest of the morally gray Cosmo Babylonia vs. Federation 
conflict.) and the foreshadowing couldve been much better. If they wanted to justify a massacre like this, they needed to directly show instead of tell. Maybe have the colony
be very crowded and urban, like a space Hong Kong with cramped and packed streets, and overpopulation being obvious from rampant homelessness and poverty, along with a throwaway
line about it being like this everywhere in the Earth Sphere right now. Would've also contributed to the themes of class warfare.

The Crossbone Vanguard

The Crossbone Vanguard as an army does not make sense here. They are by definition and name pirates. Even if they were formed as a front organization for Cosmo Babylonia, they are still
pirates, not a formal military. Thematically, it contradicts the goals and ideals of the noble and fascist Cosmo Babylonia to employ what amount to mercenaries for hire
rather than an official military. It would have made more sense to have them by themed as knights in service to the aristocracy akin to Gjallarhorn from Iron-Blooded Oprhans. Alternatively, they
could have made the distinction that the noble Cosmo Babylonia officers look down upon the mercenary Crossbone Vanguard and see them as pawns, adding to the class warfare theme, and
peaking in the Vanguard turning on Cosmo Babylonia. Instead, we have rich aristocrats treating what should be the only army possibly less loyal than the Federation at this time like loyal 
soldiers ready to die for them at a moment's notice. This is made weirder by the fact that they actually kind of do this. They march in their military parades for Cosmo Babylonia as if 
they're the official state military, they go out of their way to try and minimize mass destruction and civilian casualties simply because Cosmo Babylonia said they should, even though it 
would be completely in character for most pirates to engage in senseless destruction and violence. I don't know about you but when I think ""honorable and loyal"", pirates are about the 
last thing I think about, one notch above straight-up thieves and barbarians.

Annemarie

I don't know which writer it was at Sunrise, but somebody had a very low opinion of women back in the day. Annemarie is approximately the 3rd woman in Gundam to change sides simply 
because her love interest is not reciprocating her feelings and she saw a hunky guy on the other side rather than fundamentally disagreeing with the ideals and/or methods of the faction 
she is fighting for. Granted at least one of those could be chalked up to possible Newtype mind control powers (I don't think this is a canon ability of Newtypes, but it's the only way I 
can reconcile Reccoa defecting to the Titans just to be with Scirocco in the same season that Sarah also nearly defects to the AEUG because she develops a crush on Katz.) but
it's made worse by the fact that Annemarie is only shown in two scenes prior to this, her relationship with Zabine is given no time to breathe, and she gets almost zero character 
development. To top it all off, they could have easily written a much less stupid reason for her to defect by having her stumble upon the Bugs being tested and choosing to defect because 
she, like most rational people, does not agree with senselessly slaughtering civilians.

The overall lack of memorable anything

Maybe this is just me as a fan of mecha designs with cool gimmicks or recognizable designs, but I find that nothing from F91 stands out mechanically. I have models of suits
from just about every season except this one. And it's mostly because nothing about any of the suits stand out as unique enough for me to want to look at it and play with it more.
Even the star design, the F91, the coolest thing is the cannons on the back which can become rifles. Whee. It's other signature gimmick is an invisible one. The Bio-Computer is
pretty lame and uninteresting, just letting you detect people or something?! Maybe they planned more for it and didnt have time to flesh it out. Regardless, as far as gimmicks go, they're 
pretty mediocre. The beam shields are silly, and the downsizing of the suits feels way too much like a desperate money-saving attempt for the toys. Overall, the suits all look bland, 
except the Vangaurd suits but even those feel... a little familiar...

A little too much Star Wars influence

This movie just reeks of ""The writer watched Return of the Jedi before he wrote this"". Between the Vanguard suits looking a little too Darth Vader-like or their own good, Iron Mask
bearing a strong resemblance in every way to Darth Vader, the strained relationship between Cecily and her father Iron Mask, and the Cosmo Babylonia anthem sounding exactly like the 
opening chords to the Imperial March on loop, there's way too many similaities. All it's missing is a climactic beam saber duel between Cecily and Iron Mask with a shriveled old Newtype

Where I see the problem though is not his motivations, but what his intentions actually were, from what I see people get is that Char wanted revenge and to send earth into hibernation

I believe that this is not the case, I believe that a few people have got a vauge idea of what CCA was but I want to steamroll that flat and I want to see if you guys agree
 
So, what I got was that Char did give up on humanity but didn’t actually want to kill everyone, what he wanted was to scare and make people on Earth leave for space, first sending a warning shot to show he was serious in the form of Lhasa betting destroyed, then giving them a final warning in the form of Axis, now Char knew through being a Newtype that if he was going to do something “Very Evil” in his own words, he knew Amuro would somehow be able to stop it in the words “please stop me”, otherwise Char would definitely be evil, which means that he wouldn’t say he was “Very Evil” because he wouldn’t care about being evil or not. Another piece of evidence is when Amuro argues with Char instead of killing him, which Amuro obviously has no apprehension for doing since he would have thought Char had gone down the wrong path, this shows that Amuro could feel that Char had good intentions and didn’t actually want Axis to drop, and fitting with my idea of Newtypes understanding each other, they can only grasp basic intentions and raw emotions, thus making Amuro so confused when his instinct and Newtype powers were telling him that Char had good intentions while Char’s actions were actually contradicting the intentions, making Amuro want to argue about how to save humanity when he felt that Char was trying to save it when Char was obviously trying to kill it by dropping Axis, also explaining why Axis was pushed back by the Newtype Shock when it takes two Newtypes exerting directed power to do so, also proving that Char was also trying to push back Axis when he was still arguing with Amuro in their last moments, this shows that unlike some people think, Char wasn’t evil, Char didn’t want to kill everyone on earth, Char didn’t go insane, and Char was a good guy to the very end

The movie itself was alright. The highlight of it is simply the gundam redesigns and seeing the epilogue of everyone. Villain was kinda weak though. Wanted to see an epic showdown between the protagonist and an antagonistic gundam pilot but there was none. Only actual new gundam in this is the Tallgeese lll. Which is pretty badass.

Something subtle about Wing is that the pilots sans Wufei (usually) get paired off and their dynamics explored. 

I find I most enjoy Heero/Duo and Heero/Trowa with Duo/Quatre being third

Heero/Duo feels like classic buddy cop shenanigans and while Duo is often a clear annoyance to Heero you can feel the respect in their relationship possibly better than any other pairing. Duo KNOWS that Heero has his back. Similarly while Heero does have some disdain for Duo, he believes in his ability to rise to the task which is why he sticks his neck out for Duo.

Heero/Trowa goes really hard on the fact that both characters are at the extreme end of Stoicism. While Trowa does stan Heero a little hard at times it's pretty clear that Heero respects Trowa's competence while Trowa respects Heero's character. This of course culminates when Trowa loans his beloved Heavyarms to Heero for his duel with Zechs. 

Duo/Quatre feels like the most overall positive dynamic of the 5. The two very clearly understand the need to bring the Gundam Pilots together, and from the outset the two are on the same team and are amicable to working together more than the other pilots. While I think Quatre is easily the weakest character in terms of writing, I have a certain appreciation for the role he plays with Duo.

A teacher asked him if he wanted a job doing storyboard work on a **‘DORAEMON’** episode. This led to some freelance work at Sunrise Studio, where Ikeda worked for director Ryosuke Takahashi as a storyboard artist in the mecha series **‘VOTOMS’** and **‘GALIENT’**. Takahashi recommended Ikeda for his first directing job, **‘鎧伝サムライトルーパー’** (a.k.a. **‘RONIN WARRIORS’**). Since then, Ikeda’s career has led him to helm action-packed series such as **‘VAMPIRE HUNTER’** (a.k.a. **‘NIGHT WARRIORS: DARKSTALKERS REVENGE’**), **’GUNDAM WING’**, and **‘RYU KNIGHT: ADIEUS LEGEND’**.

**‘GUNDAM WING’**, along with **‘VAMPIRE HUNTER’**, is an occasion of Ikeda teaming up with character designer Shuko Murase, also the designer for **‘STREET FIGHTER II: THE ANIMATED MOVIE’**. In this interview, Ikeda is quick to credit a large part of **‘GUNDAM WING’**s popularity to Murase’s character designs. *“When I work with Murase, the level of completion he delivers in his works is far better by a magnitude,” Ikeda says. “If you think about the amount of work he puts in, he should have time for nothing much else. With that in mind, any positive praise from viewers about the show should be deservedly for him.”*
________________________________________________________________________________
 
**ANIMERICA: Let me ask you about** ***‘GUNDAM WING’***, **How did you get involved in this project?**

**IKEDA:** *“After Yoshiyuki Tomino’s* ***’V GUNDAM’***, *there was a show called* ***‘G GUNDAM’*** *by director [Yasuhiro] Imagawa that didn’t have Tomino’s involvement. It was around that time when Bandai decided on multiple Gundams, as opposed to the previous shows, such as the one about Amuro’s Gundam, where that alone is the center of the story. That’s how* ***‘G GUNDAM’*** *came to be. The year after that, they decided to let another young kid try out another multiple*  ***GUNDAM*** *story, and that’s when someone suggested ‘Ikeda’. So I go involved almost at the start, when all they knew was that they wanted a show with five Gundams.”*

**ANIMERICA: How did you like creating your very own** ***‘GUNDAM’***  **show?**

**IKEDA:** *“Well, I worked with character designer and animation directors to come up with the characters and to come up with a five-Gundam story as opposed to Tomino’s*  ***‘GUNDAM’***. *I watched all of Tomino’s* ***‘GUNDAM’*** *shows and extrapolated how he might do a five-Gundam story. I hoped something of his flavor should show up on screen.  After all, if it has the name* ***‘GUNDAM’***, *you can’t keep the name Tomino off your mind. I could mention the kind of care I took in that respect.”*

**ANIMERICA:  What are your views on** ***‘GUNDAM’***? **Are you a part of the generation that grew up watching the series?**

**IKEDA:** *“Well, I didn’t watch* ***‘GUNDAM’*** *when it first came on the air. I was at the age when people tend to stop watching animated shows. But when it comes to views on*  ***‘GUNDAM’***, *-- it’s such a major show that most anyone who watches animation must have some kind of view on it.”*

*I think this might be related to Murase’s character-making, but I think it’s a show that depicts a person’s internal aspects. In Tomino’s depiction of the character’s’ interior lives, he has a unique way of cornering his characters that I don’t necessarily like. Whereas he corners his characters into a tragic point of no return, I’d like to shove mine into a hard-fought, brighter tomorrow. My optimism shows in that kind of child-oriented, rather than* ***‘GUNDAM’*** *-oriented, direction, and I think* ***‘GUNDAM WING’*** *did go that way.*

*I do think that* ***‘GUNDAM’*** *is about the internal worlds of the main characters, and Murase’s designs are about the surfaces of a character, but include so much of the minute expressions he’d show and whatnot that by the time his draft is done, he comes up with characters with far more internals [showing on the surface] than I expected. So although I was involved with* ***‘GUNDAM WING’*** *from the beginning, a lot of the work went into how I could make Murase’s come to life and make them breathe.*

*Since Murase was involved in Tomino’s* ***‘GUNDAM’*** *as well, such as in* ***‘F-91’***, *he was aware of how I wanted to pursue a* ***‘GUNDAM’*** *-style world in the show, and he’d draft character designs with the kind of dimensions thy needed. I think the convergence of all this effort as where* ***‘GUNDAM WING’*** *‘s flavors came from, not just through my own.”*
________________________________________________________________________________


**ANIMERICA:** ***‘GUNDAM WING’*** **s characters, especially the main characters, are also very pretty types. Was this intentional too?**

**IKEDA:** [Laughs] *“Well, this time, the character designer wasn’t [Norio] Shioyama*  (***‘VOTOMS’***) *, but Murase, and the characters are younger than most animation main characters. They still have their futures ahead of them. I asked him for the five characters with that kind of purity and possibilities. In that sense, I would think the pure things have a beauty of their own, and as they grow up, they might get dirtier. But I had his help with the purity aspect. As for whether they’re pretty, I’m not sure of the beauty of purity translates directly to their pretty faces…*

*It’s nice you can glance at the characters and find appeal in the drawings, but I think non-pretty-face characters can still carry a story. Perhaps [the series] would’ve been easier [to do] if the characters were just pretty faces.”*

**ANIMERICA:** ***’GUNDAM WING’*** **s main characters look like invincible superheroes compared to the other characters and mecha in the show. Was this your idea?**

**IKEDA:** *“Well, I hadn’t given it that much thought. But Tomino’s* ***GUNDAM*** *that I previously mentioned is about a regular civilian who gets involved in a war, pilots mecha, and shows latent talent as a Newtype. I think that’s Tomino’s style for* ***GUNDAM***. *I suppose that might be the proper way to take on his* ***GUNDAM*** *legacy, but a good way to show the five Gundams winning and please the sponsor was to show the five as complete soldiers from the start and show them a lot onscreen. Pursuing that avenue of thought, the main characters aren’t supposed to die, so if that makes them look invincible, if the kids are immediately victorious in episode 1, maybe that does make them superheroes.”*

**ANIMERICA: So the other military personnel in the show aren’t complete soldiers, but what shall we say—plebes?**

**IKEDA:** *“Well, okay, first, what about the main characters do you call superheroish?”*
________________________________________________________________________________



**ANIMERICA: Well, could a normal junior-high-school student who just happens to get involved in war heal his broken leg just by twisting it?**

**IKEDA:** *“I think healing a broken leg by yourself is something that we can conceivably do. If given the proper training and desperation, we could all do it. And our main characters aren’t doing their jobs for fun. The existence of their colonies is at stake. The resentment toward Earth may have been artificially planted by the grownups as the only necessary information. But only by putting themselves into dire straits can they release their explosive life energy, along with their anger. I’m sure ordinary people can get to that point too.”*

**ANIMERICA: So a normal junior-high student could do it?**

**IKEDA:** *“Yes.”*

**ANIMERICA: Now, what was the purpose of naming all the major characters after numbers?**

**IKEDA:** *“This was chief writer [Katuyuki] Sumisawa’s doing. I wasn’t too concerned with that. My job was to give Murase’s characters a place to show off.”*

**ANIMERICA: About Quatre’ character design: Was he always male and not female?**

**IKEDA:** *“Yes, the main characters were always five boys.”*

**ANIMERICA: Of all the five, Quatre alone looks almost like a girl.**

**IKEDA:** *“Oh, I did think it would be bad if all five looked indistinguishable. An issue was how to get the tory going with five or so Gundams. If five same-age boys were there, one might be easily provoked, another might be kind, and a third might keep the peace between those two. The five started with those kinds of preset personalities. As preproduction work progressed, Murase came up with the drafts for the characters, with their personalities s well as their looks. We thought that their personalities could freely change and become similar s the story progressed. But as for Quatre, he had to have the gentleness that would be able to embrace everyone and that would set him differently from the other boys.”*

**ANIMERICA: A gentleness that would even embrace Heero’s hopeless suicidal tendencies?**

**IKEDA:** *“I suppose so. Although this story wasn’t about the five of them uniting together. They could have acted fully independently.”*
________________________________________________________________________________



**ANIMERICA: What is the relationship between Heero and Relena?**

**IKEDA:** *“Well, according to the story as far as I was involved in it, the girl Relena represented what was still good about Earth, and I wanted her to talk to the main characters that way. Starting with Heero, all five of them are the same, but they are in war propagated by grownups in which you go with the flow, and firepower is the deciding factor. I wanted Relena to represent something different, where people could instead resolve differences with a sincere dialogue. So rather than talk about her relationship to Heero, I think of her more as a representation of the good that’s left on Earth.”*

**ANIMERICA: So they have no boy-girl relationship?**

**IKEDA:** *“Well, you could say I was nurtured in a Ryosuke Takahashi world, and that may have something to do with it. I have a hard time with female characters. Boy-girl-relationship type situations are still beyond my capabilities. So that wasn’t something on my mind.”*

*”I think that my job is in exposing the raw interior of the characters. And, of course, the inspiration for working on the interiors of the characters is in Murase’s designs, with the expressions on their faces that indicate deep personalities within. My job is in deciding how to pursue that. When I work with Murase, the level of completion in which he delivers his works is far  better by magnitude. If you think bout the amount of work he puts in, he shouldn’t really have time for much else. With that in mind, any positive praise from viewers about the show should be deservedly for him. Although Id have my own satisfaction of knowing I was able to utilize his characters well. But I think it’s right to be impressed by Murase’s characters.”*

**ANIMERICA: Of you take this idea to the extreme, wouldn’t you be watching the show not for the mecha but for the characters?** 

**IKEDA:** *“Well, yes, but I tend to focus more on the characters. Of course, you won’t lays be able to find those kinds of characters every time. Nd then, depending on the project you’re invited to work on, there are different things you can do. For this project, and it’s still the same for the current project we’re working on* (**‘VAMPIRE HUNTER’**), *I get to be taking care of Murase’s characters. But if I were to work on a mecha-over-character show, I’d have to give first priority to how the mecha would be fighting and how to make them look good on screen.”*

Something occurs to me that didn’t in 2001-2003. I was interpreting the Universal Century from a then contemporary perspective. I saw Gundam as a potential future of humanity moving into space after a post-9/11 world and the 90’s view of Western Democracy as the “End of History”. 

 I failed to interpret it from the era it was made in. So my question is; where is Communism in the Universal Century? The Earth Federation is clearly a liberal capitalist democracy and the Principality of Zeon is putting on the Reich with its economics a bit more inscrutable. Even something like Cosmos Babylon (conceived at the end of the Cold War) is reminiscent of the contemporary yet niche concept of the Dark Enlightenment was long out of vogue by 1991. Factions throughout Gundam are wildly politically and economically diverse.

Sure the One Year War was a sci-fi retelling of World War II, but the Soviet Union was a crucial power, pivotal in the resolution of that conflict. I find it fascinating because the core foundation fo the UC was established in the 80’s, at the same time Star Trek had a ship built in the USSR and William Gibson’s unused script for Alien 3 took place aboard a communist space station. Was it prescient, and oversight, or simply something creators were uninterested in exploring?

Transcript of the Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Panel at the Cloud Matsuri virtual convention on Sunday  22^(nd) November, 2020 at 5pm to 6pm GMT

**Panelists:**

* **Jonathan Clements:** Anime Historian
* **Mitsuo Fukuda:** Director at Sunrise, Inc.
* **Hiroomi Ikeya:** Assistant Line Producer at Sunrise, Inc.
* **Bethan Jones:** Interpreter

**Clements:** Today we are talking about a very special Gundam, Gundam SEED. Special because it has the fantastic achievement of at one point occupying the eight of the top ten anime DVD best-selling slots in Japan, and also was the first Gundam since the original in 1979 to win the Grand Prix from Animage magazine. And today to talk about this eighteen year-old series with us, ahead of its HD remastered release in December 2020, are the director, Mitsuo Fukuda, and the line producer, Hiroomi Ikeya. Thank-you gentlemen, for joining us.

**Fukuda:** Hello everyone, I am the director of Gundam SEED TV series, Mitsuo Fukuda.

**Clements:** And Mr. Ikeya, there are many different ways that a producer can work on a production, we have twelve of them listed in our translation guide. So, could you please tell us a little bit about what you did on the production on the production yourself, as a line producer?

**Ikeya:** I’m Hiroomi Ikeya from Sunrise. At the time of Gundam SEED, I was working on the production desk, so I was more like a production assistant at that point working on the scheduling. Now, I’m a producer, I have a producer, I have more oversight over the whole production, and I liaise with external parties as well, so I’m more of a line producer now.

**Clements:** And as you may both be aware, we’ve solicited questions from fandom, which means we have an absolutely huge number of them, and we’ll do our best to get through them in the best way that we can. We may well regret letting the fans choose what to ask, but we’re gonna give it go.

**Fukuda:** No worries.

**Clements:** Well, let’s see. First I’d like to ask both of you, how you got started working in the anime business?

**Fukuda:** Well, when I was at high school, I was already interested in manga, in animation, in novels and all of that Otaku culture, and I was at the stage where I had to decide between going onto higher education or going to work, and I failed my exams. So, right at this point where I was wondering what I should do with my life and it was a bit of a loose end, I heard Sunrise were looking for people, and I thought “give it a go” and they hired me. And now, the anime industry is what it is. We have these nice buildings, and it’s a big industry, but back then, it was a tiny little studio, everyone was piled in on top of each other, working from morning ‘til night and it wasn’t a really well respected industry back then.

**Ikeya:** As a student, I used to make 8mm films, and I loved film. I wanted to work in film, not just animation at that point, but I was interested in live action, I was interested in TV, but I got into Sunrise. In fact, Sunrise was the only place I got into, and I loved robot anime as a child, so it kind of destiny that I should end up working here. 

**Clements:** Now, Fukuda-san, you mentioned that you went straight from school to Sunrise, you joined, if I’m right, in 1979 so you must have been about nineteen year-old, and that was the year that the original Gundam aired. So what was it like working for Sunrise at that time?

**Fukuda:** When I joined Sunrise, Gundam, the TV series, was still in production so I got to see that up-close. It was a very small studio so it was very up-close, and Tomino-san was basically getting cross a lot.

**Clements:** So nothing has changed, in fact.

**Clements:** So when you, yourself, became a director on Gundam SEED, you worked on a large number of other shows and then, I think Gundam SEED was your first Gundam production and you went in as director, but \[quoting a fan question\] was Yoshiyuki Tomino’s directing style an influence when you directed Gundam SEED?

**Fukuda:** I actually did storyboards on Victory Gundam.

**Clements:** Ok, I’m sorry I was misinformed by Wikipedia. But actually, let me just jump in at this point, then. Because this is something that even Gundam fans in Britain may not be aware of. If Tomino had never made Gundam, he would still be a very important figure in the Japanese animation business because of the influence he has in the creation of storyboards of a [conte](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conte#French). So same question applies on Victory Gundam, as with Gundam SEED. So what, if anything, did you draw as inspiration from his work?

**Fukuda:** There was definitely an influence from Tomino-san. The directing techniques that I’ve learnt come from the same studio, the same company that makes these robot anime. And so, to a greater or lesser degree, I’ve always been aware of his influence, and Gundam is Tomino’s worldview, and you can’t make Gundam without that.

**Clements:** This was the first Gundam series of the 21st series. I know there were little things like G-Saviour and Green Diver, but they weren’t TV shows. The first Gundam show of the 21st Century to go into production, the first of the 21st century, the first after 9/11, a terrorist event in which the Japanese lost 24 lives. So were there any specific influences when it came to the creation of Gundam SEED, beyond the desire to do another Gundam series?

**Fukuda:** The original Gundam was made right after the Vietnam War and was really influenced by the Vietnam War. The staff who worked on that, were a generation above me, some of them were born during the Asia-Pacific war, some of them were born just after. But, we’re a later generation now, and we’ve only heard their stories, we didn’t experience it, so we wanted a new Gundam that was more inline with what we know, which was 9/11, the Iraq War, Afghanistan—they needed to be part of the new worldview.

**Clements:** So what was the view from the production desk, were these subtexts something that was considered during production, or was this regarded as a sci-fi show?

**Ikeya:** Gundam SEED was the first Gundam project that I had been involved in. So at the time for me, it was very much about being involved in Gundam. But looking back, I can see that the theme of encountering people from different ethnicities is there in Gundam SEED.

**Clements:** And this is a question, which I think the production desk can answer and if not we’ll try Mr. Fukuda. But \[quoting a fan question\] what was the biggest inspiration for the creation of Kira Yamato?

**Fukuda:** The idea of Kira Yamato’s character actually came from my wife, Chiaki Morosawa. She had read in the newspaper, the story of an Iraqi soldier fighting for the U.S. Army, in the Iraq War, so he was essentially fighting his own country.

**Clements:** Since you mentioned your late wife, Morosawa-san, I’d like to ask as well about the decision, that someone must have taken, for this to be an entirely different timeline, this is set in a different century in the Cosmic Era, so there has been some decision made at some point in the writing process for this to be not the Universal Century but, what I’m going to call a different timeline and wait to be corrected. Why was that decision taken with Gundam SEED?

**Fukuda:** I think there was a lot of discussion about that, but in the end, I think it was Yoshi, the president of Sunrise at the time, who decided that it shouldn’t be part of the same timeline. 

**Clements:** We got some very specific questions about Lacus Clyne, firstly \[paraphrasing a fan question\] who did you turn to for inspiration for that character?

**Fukuda:** I didn’t design the characters, so Lacus Clyne wasn’t my idea. She was pretty much entirely Chiaki Morosawa’s idea. I do remember her saying that the idea of Lacus Clyne was that she would be a mirror of other people, and that was why she was necessary to reflect other people’s hearts. As to who she was inspired by, I think there’s a bit of Chiaki Morosawa in there, which is frightening.

**Clements:** The designs for the Gundam mecha in this show were by Kunio Okawara, Kimitoshi Yamane—designers who’ve been working with Gundam for a very long time. So, the question is \[paraphrasing a fan question\] how much input did you have into these Gundam designs? Working on the assumption that, presumably, these people are so scary that maybe you don’t want to tell them what to do? Or maybe you had very specific ideas about what you wanted in this show.

**Fukuda:** I wrote a concept for the mobile suits in Gundam SEED and gave it to Okawara-san. For some of them I did a rough design that I handed over for Okawara-san to work with. The suits themselves were 100% Okawara-san and then Yamane worked more on the ships and the other types of machines.

**Clements:** And \[paraphrasing a fan question\] what Mobile Suits from previous series, if any, helped inspired the designs of the Strike Gundam and Freedom Gundam?

**Fukuda:** No previous Gundams, no.

**Clements:** And Mr. Ikeya, a question for both of you, but I want to run this one past you from the production desk. \[Paraphrasing a fan question\] What is your favorite suit from Gundam SEED, and why?

**Ikeya:** Yeah, I like the Strike Dagger, because I like the mass-produced Gundams, so that’s why I like that particular one.

**Clements:** Same question for Mr. Fukuda, what’s your favourite Gundam from Gundam SEED? You can’t say all of them.

**Fukuda:** I actually prefer the ships to the mobile suits, I really like the *Archangel*.

**Clements:** Okay, we won’t tell Bandai!

**Clements:**  \[Paraphrasing a  fan question\] So when Kira states that the Freedom—this is now getting very very fan-ish and very specific, we’re not even sure if we’re gonna understand the answer if you have one—but, when Kira states that the Freedom Gundam has four times the power of the Strike Gundam, what quantity is he referring to, and is there a precise range or number you can give? I have to say as well, I didn’t write that question, this has all come in from fandom!

**Fukuda:** Everything on the Gundams in this series; the weapons, the defense systems, the movement, it all relies on battery power, and the Strike runs out of battery quite a lot. So I think that’s what it refers to when he says that the Freedom Gundam has more power.

**Clements:** Right, okay, yes. So for those watching in black &amp; white, this is a reference to the fact that power systems on Earth have been shut down by PLANT, so everything has to run on battery, okay , I understand. So, another question here about the Cosmic Era, we’ve got a fan question here that says \[paraphrasing a fan question\] where did the ideas come for the different continental/regional federations? And here’s a very odd political addendum, do you think we’re moving further towards them?

**Fukuda:** So when we were writing Gundam SEED, creating the worldview, I was actually working with Yoshino-san, the scenario writer, who used to be a history teacher. And, so we had a lot of discussions, and actually Yoshino-san gave me a lecture on the history of the world over the last 2000 years. So how society’s changed, how religion has changed the world and we had a lot of discussion around this, and that was where the idea for having these federations came from. I think society at that time, when we were making SEED, was quite different to now but we did think a lot about how society was at that time, when we were making it.

**Clements:** Okay, this is a very generic question that’s been inserted in here, so I’m gonna to throw it at Mr. Ikeya as well as and Mr. Fukuda, but Mr. Ikeya, first. \[Paraphrasing a fan question\] Do you have a favourite episode of Gundam SEED? And If so, why that one?

**Ikeya:** I like the first episode of Gundam SEED. There’s the excitement of something new beginning and then how you get to that end part of the episode when the Gundam stands up, symbolising the start of a new Gundam.

**Clements:** Same question for Mr. Fukuda, but actually, I’m gonna try my luck here and add an addendum of my own, I’d like to know what your favourite episode of Gundam SEED is and why, but also, I’m much more interested in your least favourite episode, is there one episode that was really difficult to get out and has haunted you ever since?

**Fukuda:** Well, there are no episodes that I don’t like, and they were all hard work, I don't recall any of them being easy. But, the final episode, I directed myself and I did the storyboards myself, so that’s very memorable and was particularly tough but very worthwhile.

**Clements:** Here is a very long question which I’m gonna have to read out, that’s how long it is. \[Quoting a fan question\] The World of SEED is rife with upheaval and mistrust, with innocent young people caught up in its events. Given the chaotic times we’re living through in reality, do you feel this gives Gundam SEED a renewed relevance to audiences?

**Fukuda:** I think you’d have to ask the viewers about that one. The theme of Gundam SEED is war. You mentioned upheaval and mistrust, but what it’s actually depicting is the experience and the story of Kira and his friends, and what it shows them trying to do is to break out of the pigeonholes that they’ve been put into. And at the time, that was a big issue in Japanese schools and in Japanese workplaces, and it was something I thought a lot about as being the basis for fighting between people, so in away, it was a Japanese issue that I was trying to confront with Gundam SEED, and I’m not entirely sure how well that comes across to a global audience because it’s a Japanese psychology.

**Clements:** True enough, and this leads into our next question which was about the kind of people that you expect to watch Gundam SEED. This has been a very successful iteration of the franchise, and when you were first creating it, was the hope to bring in new fans to Gundam ? To kind of reset to zero? Or were you writing something to cater to the existing fans?

**Fukuda:** Gundam SEED wasn’t really intended for the existing Gundam fans, it was aimed at a new target audience with the new era, the new Cosmic Era, and also targeting young people that were facing the issues that Gundam SEED deals with. Gundam The Origin was also around at the time, so there was material out there for the existing fans, but I wanted to take a different approach.

**Clements:** Mr. Ikeya, what do you remember about your time on Gundam SEED? When you look back on it, what are the experiences that you had on that show that still stay with you today?

**Ikeya:** Well, as Fukuda-san said, each of the episodes was hard work; it was hard work for them because it was a robot anime, and it was hard work because we were working on it for a full year.

**Clements:** And just to point out, once again, to our viewers, that’s quite rare in the anime business. We were moving at that time into a situation where the average anime show would only run for 1 cour (would run for 13 episodes). So it’s only the very very big shows, the ones that people are really putting their money behind will run for 26 or 52 and in the case—I’m trying to remember how many there were in  Gundam SEED, we had Gundam SEED and then we had Gundam Destiny\[sic\] so it was like a 100 episodes or more, right?

**Clements:** \[Quoting a fan question\] If there was something you could go back to change about Gundam SEED in retrospect, what would you change?

**Fukuda:** I think if I had the chance to go back and change anything, I’d remake the whole thing! I did get to fix a lot when we released the remastered edition. I “tricked” Sunrise into letting me fix a lot, and then after my question he said, I told them that I would maybe fix 500 shots, I ended up fixing a thousand.

**Clements:** I want to get back onto this HD Remaster, it’s one of the worst kept secrets of the anime business that when something goes from television to DVD or Blu-ray, that sometimes the staff will sneak in and fix stuff. You just have alluded to having fixed like a thousand shots within Gundam SEED, but what kind of changes were you making?

**Fukuda:** This is secret!

**Clements:** It’s ok, nobody’s watching!

**Fukuda:** I did something to pretty much every shot, and I messed around with the editing a bit, and I changed the music a bit. I was trying to make it all the same because what had happened was TV had gone from 4 by 3 to 16 by 9, and I wanted to fit the series to that screen ratio so that it would survive another 10‒20 years. And so, in the process of changing from 4 by 3 to 16 by 9, we had to increase the resolution, pull it all apart (basically backed its cells) and then refilm them, essentially. And then in the process of doing that we made little tweaks along the way, it was a painstaking process.

**Clements:** And with that in mind, were there any (this is for Mr. Fukuda, again), were there any unexpected challenges when working with the HD Remaster? It sounds like you knew exactly what you were doing but was there anything that took you by surprise, when working with those materials? Such as, for example, losing some of the materials, which I know has happened on some anime shows?

**Fukuda:** We did lose some of them materials actually, but we did find them all in the end, and it was just a case of pulling everything apart and putting it back together. And we did cut out the recap episodes in the remastered version.

**Clements:** Now as we’re going to be releasing this series on Blu-ray in English and French very soon, there’s likely to be people watching who haven’t seen Gundam SEED before. With that in mind, how would you describe the series to a potential new viewer?

**Fukuda:** Well I know that Grendizer was popular in France because of the beautiful animation and the music, and I like that kind of animation too, and I hope that Gundam SEED will fit into that character. I think if you already know Gundam and enjoy Gundam, you’ll like this film, but if you're coming to it new, I hope the people will think of it not as a robot animation but as what it is which is a story of Kira and Athrun.

**Clements:** I’m afraid with that, we are, in fact, running out of time. We’ve already ran a little bit over actually, so thank you very much for staying with us for this long. Mr. Ikeya, I’m very sorry we didn’t have more questions for you, but sadly my hands are tied by the desires of the fans to know about all sorts of things they’re not supposed to ask about. Mr. Fukuda, thank you very much for talking to us about Gundam SEED, 18 years ago and Gundam SEED, now as well. If you would like to send a message to your fans in Europe, in the style of Japanese interviews, now is your chance to do so. Thank you very much for talking to us, today.

**Fukuda:** I never thought that this anime that I worked so hard to make 20 years ago would be seen by so many people around the world. So, it’s really fantastic. I wish that I could be in Europe, that I could visit the UK, and France, and the rest of Europe. Unfortunately, that’s not possible right now, but it’s been great to communicate with you online like this, so thank you very much.

**Clements:** And Mr. Ikeya?

**Ikeya:** Thank you. Well, as Fukuda-san said, I never imagined that Gundam SEED, that I was working on nearly 20 years ago, would have the impact that it has. And now, it’s coming out on Blu-ray in the UK and in France, which is fantastic. Gundam SEED is of course a robot anime, it is a part of the Gundam universe. But as Fukuda-san said, it’s very much a character drama, as well. So I hope that that’s the impression you will get from it and that that’s how you will watch it.

**Clements:** And with that, I’d like to thank Mr. Fukuda and Mr. Ikeya for joining us today, and Bethan Jones, our interpreter (one for us always), and thank-you for joining us!",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,92562,public,self,,,[Transcript] Cloud Matsuri Gundam SEED Panel ft.

The only gundam ones that came close were 8th ms and war in the pocket.

Now as I learn more about gundams little details I've had some issues with reported heights and weights. In short the reported heights of og gundam are way to much for their actual weight. A 60 ton zaku shouldn't be 18 meters tall. Most tanks today are that weight but nowhere near that length.

We could increase their weight to match their height, but that makes it even more unbelievable for me if a 100+ ton mech is doing pirouettes in earth's gravity. Better to keep the reported weight I think.

So do you guys think gundam might do for a restructuring of heights. Personally I think smaller mobile suits make more sense for combat (smaller target to hit, easier to hide in cover).

It’s one of the best experiences I’ve had with a piece of Gundam media. The easiest way I can explain Hooligans is to just say that it’s 08th MS Team but not awful. It takes the stereotype of the ground E.F.F. MS team, and makes it funny as hell. We see 3-4 unique Federation teams, all with different names and MS. It has a goofy as hell first half, with a really serious and stressful second half that makes you nervous for even the most minor of characters. 

The story: The story starts off as a team of ace pilots training rookies, but at the end of Volume 2 that changes for the better. It gets more serious, despite keeping the hilarity of the characters. Speaking of...

The characters: the main protagonist is Yuji, a kindhearted idiot who joined just so he could help with relief efforts after the colony drop. Despite his kindness, it’s undeniable that he’s not the brightest of the bunch. The rest of the Nemesis team are also pretty good. You have Hawk Reuser, a womanizing dumbass who’s still badass. Doug Kyson, a religious man who seems to be unable to talk normally, usually whispering into another teammates ear and having them say his words. Tara I Cicero, a young mechanic, the only survivor of a Medea crash I’m chapter 2 of the series. Enrist Panowa, the intelligent second in command of the Nemesis team. And finally, Saki Dessau, the commander. He’s the most interesting and the most well written of the team in my eyes. Now to talk about their expressiveness, I’ll have to talk about the...

Art: WFH is illustrated by Sono Yoshihiro. The art style he gives the manga tons of personality. It’s really goofy and a lot of the characters look out of place for a serious UC show, despite this fact, the art style really fits the story and tone. 

Conclusion: It’s fun and has tons of MSV suit cameos, if you love GMs, you should appreciate this manga. Also, the Acguy manga I mentioned is just as great.

But after thinking about it for a long while I think I finally grasped the significance of what happened. Doing so catapulted Unicorn from being one of my favorite Gundam series, to my all time favorite Gundam series.

Here I want to attempt to explain what I felt was the significance of Uncorn's ending was, there is a lot to break down so lets start with the beginning. This is going to be a long read so sit down.

STORY TIME!

The Universal Century was the dawning of a new age for humanity, or at least what people hope the UC would come to be. One of these hopeful people is the the Prime Minister, Ricardo Marcenas , who writes down a 15th articale on the Universal Century charter monument. On first glance it is a silly thing that he wrote, but what it meant is hope for the future to be written by those who live in the future, not by those who are part of the old world. Unfortunately this did not sit well with said old world, people were out there who did not want things to change. One of these people was Ricardo's own son George Marcenas, who along with others in the new federation government, plotted to destroy Laplace, the monument, and Ricardo all so they could blame it on extremists and cement the Federation's authority on dissidents. Another one of these people was a young boy by the name of Syam. What is important about Syam is that he was just a poor Shepard living in the middle east who understood very little about the world. All he knew was that the way the world was going was going to make things hard for his family, so when some people offered him an opportunity to do something about it, he jumped at the chance. And so Syam and his fellow terrorists destroyed laplace, not knowing that they too were to meet their fate right afterwards because the organizers were smart enough to know not to let assassins live. But through some luck Syam was able to survive, and he just so happened to come across the Universal Century charter monument as he drifted through space.

After making it back to Earth, Syam did not return to the life he had lived before, he had much larger aspirations. He managed to marry into the wealthy Vist family and through careful management as well as a fair bit of lobbying (blackmailing the government with the monument and the things he knew) he was able to turn a small store called Anaheim Electronics into a monopolizing mega-corporation. He also created the vist foundation during this time. For a few decades the Federation is also using the authority it gave itself to crush all Earth based rebelions. Syam went from a father to a grandfather, one of this grandchildren was a boy named Cardeas, unlike his father, Cardeas had no interest in family's affairs, instead choosing to join the federation millitary. For this reason Syam much preferred his grandson to his son, this caused said son to believe that the inheritance may skip a generation (he was right) so he opted to try and take his father's place by force. It did not work, and Syam was forced to outlive his traitorous son.

And that's when things started to go horribly, horribly wrong. Around UC 0050,a man named Zeon Deikun starts to spread his ideology in the Side 3 colony. This ideology at first glance seems rather silly, but it speaks about hope for humanity's future. This is the worst possible thing that could have happened. First, it is remarkably similar to what Ricardo Marcenas had written on the true universal century charter (a fake had been made and ""recovered""), this meant even more backlash if the public ever found out about the original monument. Second, Zeonism advocates for Spacenoid independence, something the Earth Federation was not at all eager to give, and the Spacenoids who were tired of earth federation control didn't even have to believe in the silly parts to support Zeon Deikun. Third, and worst of all, there were signs that Ricardo's and Zeon's predictions were TRUE, thus legitimizing them and making the Federation's overexerted authority illegitimate. It was at this moment that the once hopeful prayer for the future had been turned into a horrible curse that would start years of the bloodiest conflicts the world would ever know.

In UC 0068, Zeon Deikun is assassinated and his right hand man, Degwin Zabi, is quick to point fingers at the Earth Federation (I wonder why he would do that). The Zabis then become the leaders of Side 3 and declare it to be the Principality of Zeon. In UC 0079 the space colony declares its independence and rebels against the Earth Federation, sparking the One Year War, of which half of all humanity would perish in. This war would also see two new weapons of war come to the forefront. The first was the mobile suit, and the second was the psycommu, a weapon that would allow Newtypes, the evolved humans twice predicted, to utilize their abilities to their fullest. Syam by now was probably feeling guilty about everything, after all he was one of the people responsible. Syam could come forward with his knowledge, but doesn't, he had begun to wonder if doing so might just make things worse, there was a distinct possibility that it would turn out like that. He is also an old man now, having to rely on cyrogenics to keep himself alive while he makes Cardeas into his successor. By UC 0080 the Principality of Zeon is defeated and the name Zabi will forever be one remembered in infamy. Their dictatorship would be imortalized in a televised speech given by Gihren Zabi, this speech was watched by the whole world, one of these viewers was a young boy named Ridhe Marcenas, it terrified him. Only one of the Zabis would survive, a baby girl named Mineva Lao Zabi. Other names will be recorded in history such as General Revil, Char Aznable, ""The Red Comet of Loum"", and of course the Newtype boy named Amuro Ray and his mobile suit ""Gundam."" There is another baby born around this time, the son of Cardeas Vist and a woman who is not his wife, this child would be named Banagher Links.

It seems that ignoring children runs in the Vist family, Cardeas much prefered his younger illegitimate son Banagher over his older legitmate son Alberto. Alberto much like his grandfather was greedy, causing him to fall into the clutches of Cardeas' sister Martha Vist Carbine who was similarly greedy. Cardeas taught Banagher many things. The child was taught about possibility and about many good virtues that Banagher would hold onto even after forgetting all about his life with his father. Cardeas also discovered his son was a newtype. Banagher and his mother would not stay with Cardeas though, they left and would head off to another colony, Banagher's mother would die a few years later.

The decade and a half after the One year War were characterized by continuous bloody violence. Zeon remnants stuck on earth or hiding in space made terrorist attacks on the federation, the response was the founding of the Titans, an anti terrorist force who grew out of hand and had to be stopped in the Gryps war by yet another Federation group called the Anti Earth Union Group. Then the A.E.U.G. had to fight a resurgent zeon called Neo Zeon, and in UC 0093 this came to a head when a second Neo Zeon, headed by Char Aznable, son of Zeon Deikun, attempted to drop the asteriods 5th luna and axis on earth. Only one of the two made it thanks to the efforts of Londo Bell and the ace pilot Amuro Ray. The people of Earth were saved by a glowing green light that moved the falling Axis away from the earth.

Throughout this period of violence mobile suit and psycommu technology continued to advance at a rapid pace. Newtypes quickly gained a reputation for being absolute monsters in combat, able to outclass normal humans in their ability to bring death to the enemy. Such prospects led Neo Zeon and the Titans to develop artificial newtypes called cyber newtypes, living weapons who could seemingly only be stopped by real newtypes. The other important development in weapons technology was psyco-frame. Psyco-frame was very strange, even to its developers. It was just meant to be a new more compact form of psycommu, but the developers could not explain why it would glow when in use or how in the second neo zeon war it only took two cockpit's worth of it to move millions of tons of rock out of freefall. It was clear newtypes were a wild card that could cause chaos, especially with that damn Laplace's Box, the old original Universal Century Charter, still being held over therm. It was this that caused the Federation to finally put their foot down. They would disband their puppet state, The Republic of Zeon, destroy references to zeonism, and ramp up their control of space with organizations like E.C.O.A.S. And finally they would commission the UC Project and its flagship mobile suit: The Unicorn Gundams.

The Unicorn Gundam was designed with a single purpose in mind, and that was to kill newtypes. Using a full psyco-frame construction and superior design it would take over any psycommu weapons and outperform any high performance newtype mobile suits. It was a complete success, it was fully capable of destroying any sense of newtype superiority in combat. It's only flaw was that it could only do so for about five minutes before the pilot would pass out. Ironically only a newtype could pilot it to its full potential. Cardeas Vist saw the plans to destroy Zeonism and used his position as head of the Vist foundation to take over production of the Unicorn. Under his supervision the machine was given a new purpose, it was turned from a weapon of genocide to a beast of possibility that would lead its pilot to Laplace's box which was still hidden away nearly 100 years later.

The year was now UC 0096. In order to halt the Federation's plans to destroy Zeonism Cardeas Vist offered the Unicorn to Neo Zeon, now headed by a man named Full Frontal, the so called ""second coming of Char Aznable"". Martha and Alberto caught wind of this and fearing it would end the influence the Vist Foundation had over the Federation, told Londo Bell and Ecoas about what was happening. What followed was the Laplace Incident, AKA, Gundam Unicorn.

Story Time is over..................whew

So what does that story have to do with Unicorn's ending? Not all of it was really necessary for this post and I could have cut out a lot of it and you also probably already know most of it but I just thought what the hell I'll just write down the entire story. Anyways.....

Syam vist had long since taken the 15th article to heart. He was dying, he had no future to live in. He believed it was for younger people to make the choice to open the box or not since they would be the ones who would write the future, not people from the old world like him. He didn't know what would happen if the box was opened, hence why the word possibility is throw around so much.

Possibility is the enemy of those in the federation who do not want the world to change. There is some merit in that. The world in UC 0096 is actually rather stable. Zeon is no longer a big threat, they know they could easily crush them, they know where their base is. But they don't because the Sleeves are a.......convenience. As long as a militant zeon exists then that gives the federation ample excuse to use forces like Ecoas and Londo bell to quell spacenoid dissidents. The world may suck for the spacenoids but at the very least a war like the OYW cannot happen again and thus the world is stable. Things would only get more stable once Zeonism is dead and the unicorn is in service. The machine is so powerful that Full Frontal, a man so good at piloting he is like if char actually lived up to the hype, can be matched by an amatuer pilot. The Federation's stance is represented by Riddhe Marcenas, who learned of the box's contents long before Banagher or Mineva and starts to view newtypes as a source of chaos. And he is right, Zeonism's spread like wildfire was one of the key factors in starting the OYW. Riddhe however changes his mind in the end, instead wishing for a brighter world than the one he lives in.

Full Frontal is a dangerous man, he intends to use the box to turn the status quo on its head. Instead of Earthnoids on top and Spacenoids at the bottom, he would create the Side Co Prosperity Sphere where now it is the Spacenoids who are on top. The danger comes from the fact that he is perfectly willing to start a war on the same scale as the OYW over this but also by the fact that this fixes literally nothing. Life still sucks for a large number of people in the end, the only difference is that the roles have been reversed.

Mineva Lao Zabi recognizes this danger and tries to stop Cardeas from giving the box to FF. She however comes to believe that the box maybe the best chance for the salvation of not just her people, but for everyone.

Banagher is unique among Universal Century protagonists, he is a civilian, not a soldier. He has no side to fight for. He starts out the series wanting to help ""Audrey"" because he is a newtypes and newtypes fall in love at first sight (been that way since 0079). But as he progresses through his journey he meets people. People who want him to do different things with the unicorn, he is pushed and pulled around by everyone since he has not committed to a side. Bangher eventually comes to believe in possibility, and rather than use the box for the federation, zeon, earthnoids, or spacenoids, he instead decides to use it for the possibility of a brighter future for all humanity.

Now that we have established why you need to open the box, why didn't humanity react much when it was opened?

That was because it was just a silly prayer for the future written down by a guy who have been dead for more than 90 years. The significance is not immediately apparent but it is there.

The first part is how the information was given to the public. They had Mineva Lao ZABI tell everyone in the world about it. Her name alone would be enough to get most people's full attention, and they just broke all viewership records by having her face on every single TV in the world. This will have been the most televised thing in all of human history, something the public is not going to forget any time soon.

The actual information she told everyone can be broken down as ""the federation hid this from you"" and ""newtypes exist"" when you think about it those two things would not really be shocking to people in UC 0096. Plenty of spacenoids could come foreward and speak about the shady things ECOAS does, and only 3 years prior the whole world had seen just how crazy newtype shit could get.

So what does this all add up to? Mineva Lao Zabi just gave everyone something more akin to a reminder, not a revelation or a call to arms. And it is a reminder that cannot be forgotten, this was the most televised event in human history and she just told everyone the federtation's biggest lie and that newtypes exist in said unforgettable reminder. This makes the Federation's hopes of a stable future through the destruction of zeonism an impossibility and their authority is now in question. There is now a distinct possibility for change, for better or for worse.

Mineva told everyone what was inside the box and then....... nothing happens. Seemingly nothing changes. But after thinking about it for a long while I think I finally grasped the significance of what happened. Doing so catapulted Unicorn from being one of my favorite Gundam series, to my all time favorite Gundam series.   


Here I want to attempt to explain what I felt was the significance of Uncorn's ending was, there is a lot to break down so lets start with the beginning. This is going to be a long read so sit down.  


STORY TIME!  


The Universal Century was the dawning of a new age for humanity, or at least what people hope the UC would come to be. One of these hopeful people is the the Prime Minister, Ricardo Marcenas , who writes down a 15th articale on the Universal Century charter monument. On first glance it is a silly thing that he wrote, but what it meant is hope for the future to be written by those who live in the future, not by those who are part of the old world. Unfortunately this did not sit well with said old world, people were out there who did not want things to change. One of these people was Ricardo's own son George Marcenas, who along with others in the new federation government, plotted to destroy Laplace, the monument, and Ricardo all so they could blame it on extremists and cement the Federation's authority on dissidents. Another one of these people was a young boy by the name of Syam. What is important about Syam is that he was just a poor Shepard living in the middle east who understood very little about the world. All he knew was that the way the world was going was going to make things hard for his family, so when some people offered him an opportunity to do something about it, he jumped at the chance. And so Syam and his fellow terrorists destroyed laplace, not knowing that they too were to meet their fate right afterwards because the organizers were smart enough to know not to let assassins live. But through some luck Syam was able to survive, and he just so happened to come across the Universal Century charter monument as he drifted through space.  


After making it back to Earth, Syam did not return to the life he had lived before, he had much larger aspirations. He managed to marry into the wealthy Vist family and through careful management as well as a fair bit of lobbying (blackmailing the government with the monument and the things he knew) he was able to turn a small store called Anaheim Electronics into a monopolizing mega-corporation. He also created the vist foundation during this time. For a few decades the Federation is also using the authority it gave itself to crush all Earth based rebelions. Syam went from a father to a grandfather, one of this grandchildren was a boy named Cardeas, unlike his father, Cardeas had no interest in family's affairs, instead choosing to join the federation millitary. For this reason Syam much preferred his grandson to his son, this caused said son to believe that the inheritance may skip a generation (he was right) so he opted to try and take his father's place by force. It did not work, and Syam was forced to outlive his traitorous son.  


And that's when things started to go horribly, horribly wrong. Around UC 0050,a man named Zeon Deikun starts to spread his ideology in the Side 3 colony. This ideology at first glance seems rather silly, but it speaks about hope for humanity's future. This is the worst possible thing that could have happened. First, it is remarkably similar to what Ricardo Marcenas had written on the true universal century charter (a fake had been made and ""recovered""), this meant even more backlash if the public ever found out about the original monument. Second, Zeonism advocates for Spacenoid independence, something the Earth Federation was not at all eager to give, and the Spacenoids who were tired of earth federation control didn't even have to believe in the silly parts to support Zeon Deikun. Third, and worst of all, there were signs that Ricardo's and Zeon's predictions were TRUE, thus legitimizing them and making the Federation's overexerted authority illegitimate. It was at this moment that the once hopeful prayer for the future had been turned into a horrible curse that would start years of the bloodiest conflicts the world would ever know.  


In UC 0068, Zeon Deikun is assassinated and his right hand man, Degwin Zabi, is quick to point fingers at the Earth Federation (I wonder why he would do that). The Zabis then become the leaders of Side 3 and declare it to be the Principality of Zeon. In UC 0079 the space colony declares its independence and rebels against the Earth Federation, sparking the One Year War, of which half of all humanity would perish in. This war would also see two new weapons of war come to the forefront. The first was the mobile suit, and the second was the psycommu, a weapon that would allow Newtypes, the evolved humans twice predicted, to utilize their abilities to their fullest. Syam by now was probably feeling guilty about everything, after all he was one of the people responsible. Syam could come forward with his knowledge, but doesn't, he had begun to wonder if doing so might just make things worse, there was a distinct possibility that it would turn out like that. He is also an old man now, having to rely on cyrogenics to keep himself alive while he makes Cardeas into his successor. By UC 0080 the Principality of Zeon is defeated and the name Zabi will forever be one remembered in infamy. Their dictatorship would be imortalized in a televised speech given by Gihren Zabi, this speech was watched by the whole world, one of these viewers was a young boy named Ridhe Marcenas, it terrified him. Only one of the Zabis would survive, a baby girl named Mineva Lao Zabi. Other names will be recorded in history such as General Revil, Char Aznable, ""The Red Comet of Loum"", and of course the Newtype boy named Amuro Ray and his mobile suit ""Gundam."" There is another baby born around this time, the son of Cardeas Vist and a woman who is not his wife, this child would be named Banagher Links.  


It seems that ignoring children runs in the Vist family, Cardeas much prefered his younger illegitimate son Banagher over his older legitmate son Alberto. Alberto much like his grandfather was greedy, causing him to fall into the clutches of Cardeas' sister Martha Vist Carbine who was similarly greedy. Cardeas taught Banagher many things. The child was taught about possibility and about many good virtues that Banagher would hold onto even after forgetting all about his life with his father. Cardeas also discovered his son was a newtype. Banagher and his mother would not stay with Cardeas though, they left and would head off to another colony, Banagher's mother would die a few years later.  


The decade and a half after the One year War were characterized by continuous bloody violence. Zeon remnants stuck on earth or hiding in space made terrorist attacks on the federation, the response was the founding of the Titans, an anti terrorist force who grew out of hand and had to be stopped in the Gryps war by yet another Federation group called the Anti Earth Union Group. Then the A.E.U.G. had to fight a resurgent zeon called Neo Zeon, and in UC 0093 this came to a head when a second Neo Zeon, headed by Char Aznable, son of Zeon Deikun, attempted to drop the asteriods 5th luna and axis on earth. Only one of the two made it thanks to the efforts of Londo Bell and the ace pilot Amuro Ray. The people of Earth were saved by a glowing green light that moved the falling Axis away from the earth.  


Throughout this period of violence mobile suit and psycommu technology continued to advance at a rapid pace. Newtypes quickly gained a reputation for being absolute monsters in combat, able to outclass normal humans in their ability to bring death to the enemy. Such prospects led Neo Zeon and the Titans to develop artificial newtypes called cyber newtypes, living weapons who could seemingly only be stopped by real newtypes. The other important development in weapons technology was psyco-frame. Psyco-frame was very strange, even to its developers. It was just meant to be a new more compact form of psycommu, but the developers could not explain why it would glow when in use or how in the second neo zeon war it only took two cockpit's worth of it to move millions of tons of rock out of freefall. It was clear newtypes were a wild card that could cause chaos, especially with that damn Laplace's Box, the old original Universal Century Charter, still being held over therm. It was this that caused the Federation to finally put their foot down. They would disband their puppet state, The Republic of Zeon, destroy references to zeonism, and ramp up their control of space with organizations like E.C.O.A.S. And finally they would commission the UC Project and its flagship mobile suit: The Unicorn Gundams.  


The Unicorn Gundam was designed with a single purpose in mind, and that was to kill newtypes. Using a full psyco-frame construction and superior design it would take over any psycommu weapons and outperform any high performance newtype mobile suits. It was a complete success, it was fully capable of destroying any sense of newtype superiority in combat. It's only flaw was that it could only do so for about five minutes before the pilot would pass out. Ironically only a newtype could pilot it to its full potential. Cardeas Vist saw the plans to destroy Zeonism and used his position as head of the Vist foundation to take over production of the Unicorn. Under his supervision the machine was given a new purpose, it was turned from a weapon of genocide to a beast of possibility that would lead its pilot to Laplace's box which was still hidden away nearly 100 years later.  


The year was now UC 0096. In order to halt the Federation's plans to destroy Zeonism Cardeas Vist offered the Unicorn to Neo Zeon, now headed by a man named Full Frontal, the so called ""second coming of Char Aznable"". Martha and Alberto caught wind of this and fearing it would end the influence the Vist Foundation had over the Federation, told Londo Bell and Ecoas about what was happening. What followed was the Laplace Incident, AKA, Gundam Unicorn.  


Story Time is over..................whew  


So what does that story have to do with Unicorn's ending? Not all of it was really necessary for this post and I could have cut out a lot of it and you also probably already know most of it but I just thought what the hell I'll just write down the entire story. Anyways.....  


Syam vist had long since taken the 15th article to heart. He was dying, he had no future to live in. He believed it was for younger people to make the choice to open the box or not since they would be the ones who would write the future, not people from the old world like him. He didn't know what would happen if the box was opened, hence why the word possibility is throw around so much.  


Possibility is the enemy of those in the federation who do not want the world to change. There is some merit in that. The world in UC 0096 is actually rather stable. Zeon is no longer a big threat, they know they could easily crush them, they know where their base is. But they don't because the Sleeves are a.......convenience. As long as a militant zeon exists then that gives the federation ample excuse to use forces like Ecoas and Londo bell to quell spacenoid dissidents. The world may suck for the spacenoids but at the very least a war like the OYW cannot happen again and thus the world is stable. Things would only get more stable once Zeonism is dead and the unicorn is in service. The machine is so powerful that Full Frontal, a man so good at piloting he is like if char actually lived up to the hype, can be matched by an amatuer pilot. The Federation's stance is represented by Riddhe Marcenas, who learned of the box's contents long before Banagher or Mineva and starts to view newtypes as a source of chaos. And he is right, Zeonism's spread like wildfire was one of the key factors in starting the OYW. Riddhe however changes his mind in the end, instead wishing for a brighter world than the one he lives in.  


Full Frontal is a dangerous man, he intends to use the box to turn the status quo on its head. Instead of Earthnoids on top and Spacenoids at the bottom, he would create the Side Co Prosperity Sphere where now it is the Spacenoids who are on top. The danger comes from the fact that he is perfectly willing to start a war on the same scale as the OYW over this but also by the fact that this fixes literally nothing. Life still sucks for a large number of people in the end, the only difference is that the roles have been reversed.  


Mineva Lao Zabi recognizes this danger and tries to stop Cardeas from giving the box to FF. She however comes to believe that the box maybe the best chance for the salvation of not just her people, but for everyone.  


Banagher is unique among Universal Century protagonists, he is a civilian, not a soldier. He has no side to fight for.

And it shouldn't have existed but the time of the second PLANT-Alliance War.

Ok so the whole point of the phase shift armor was to make your mobile suits invunerable to conventional weapons (bullets, missiles, blades, etc). But can still be damaged by beam and other energy weapons. Which at the time of it's conception and initial deployment was a great idea. The weaponry of ZAFTs early war mobile suits consisted of missile launchers, rifles and swords which were super effective against the hills of mobile armors and battle ships. With only ships and battle stations have beam weaponry, do to their high energy consumption and overall size. Even once mobile suit sized ones were produced they were experimental and weren't super wide spread amongst Ginns.

Also you have to look into how the PS Armor reduces the operating time of the mobile significantly. With only the later n-jammer canceler and the beam recharge system effectively mitigating this

So the Earth Alliance decided that they wanted their first mobile suits to be immune to those weapons. Which makes.perfevt sense, you'd be eliminating most of your enemy forces ways of doing damage. So they're have to rely of battle ships, which couldn't accurately keep up with mobile suits. Or built more experimental mobile suit guns which would taken time to distribute amongst pilots. If this stayed the case the existence of phase shift armor would make sense.

However after the heliopolis incident Zaft was able to build effective small scale beam weapons, as you see them intergrated into theirs newer mobile suits from the BuCue onwards and Since the Earth Alliance and ORB already had beams weapons, everyone was already on an eqaul playing field weapons wise. Of course a higher percentage of EA mobile had beam weapons but they were still very much present on ZAFTs side as well. This means that the phase shift armor was not the Impenetrable shield it once was. With the only effective anti beam defence at the time being large energy shields or the panzer shields of the Forbidden Gundam

By the time of the second war every unit on the better field carried at least one beam weapon. So why put phase shift armor on any mobile suits at all. Like your then just make a unit thats just as susceptible to damage and now has a reduced operational time.

Also of course I get that PS Armor was never mass produced. But still funking up your Gundams with it wasn't really necessary.

A much more effective way to increase unit survival would be to develop effective anti beam coatings and making units more agile so they can dodge incoming fire.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,92224,public,self,,,Phase Shift Armor is kinda pointless and a waste of Time,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/k3otaj/phase_shift_armor_is_kinda_pointless_and_a_waste/,,all_ads,6,discussion,83f4319a-5fa5-11e7-8e79-0ec8348f5b38,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, I was playing Gundam VS Zeta Gundam. I was on the last mission of Kamille's storyline.

And I was getting my ass kicked by Scirocco. This is because my emulator sucked and kept lagging. Really, all I could do was circle-strafe The-O and spam beam-rifle shots, hoping to hit him. Once the Zeta's rifle ran out, I was basically dead in the water because it would take a while to re-load the beam shots. Quite a long while.

It was then I remembered the MK-II used E-Pacs for its rifle, thus had a faster reload. This meant I could keep strafing The-O and keep beaming him until he exploded.

So it came to pass that I may have created an alternate timeline where Kamille, for some Tomino-forsaken reason, deployed in the Gundam MK-II, shot at Scirocco from a safe distance away while flying around him in an easily predictable circular flight-path, and certainly could not waverider-crash him to finish him off.

Considering that groups like Zeon and ZAFT often have control over space early in their premier wars, they could easily position and launch the rods at key targets.  The only real problem I can see is a lack of tungsten, but astroid mined iridium and osmium (both far denser) should work instead, and in Zeon's case, they had forces occupying California (where they did most of the development for the Jaburo attack), which is one of the major suppliers of tungsten.

I'm also in the same boat.

But after the show dives deeper into Kazami's inferiority complex, have him unintentionally causes a catastrophic mistake that costs real lives, realizing his mistakes and change for the better... Looking at the Kazami from the last few episodes compared to his initial unlikeable self, He's come so far from how he was from the start of the show, it really makes me appreciate the change in his attitude the moment he realized the risks and repercussions in this world.

He might have hesitated at first but he eventually told Maiya the truth and took responsibility for the death of her people and brother not very long after (expecting only the worst) and I respect that... 

And when he upgraded his gunpla to the Aegis Knight, it was a pretty subtle way of showing his character development and change of idealogy; Rather than the Justice Knight (reflecting his initial desire to be a shining ""hero of justice""), his new unit is the Aegis Knight (Aegis being the name of a legendary shield, reflecting his new goal of protecting others) which I do like.

And lastly his last sign of development is when he said: ""I'm afraid but they're even more afraid."" Sure it's fine to be afraid, Gundam protagonists used to be afraid too but they went in the Gundam anyway because there are innocent people that are more afraid and you have the power to save them and they don't... So Kazami realized that this is bigger than him... And went back in to fight with Hiroto and the others to save Eldora even if there's a chance he would fell into the same fate as the Seltsam's pilot (Who formerly defends Eldora with Cuadorn until he's defeated, captured and brainwashed by Alus to commit genocidal crimes against his own will)

I find myself liking Kazami (Who feels remorseful after he realizes that his reckless self screw up HORRIBLY and causes the death of innocent lives) a lot more during the 2nd half, and I grew to like Kazami's character arc who changes to become a more heroic, selfless competent member of BUILD DiVERS; As well as finally becoming the heroic badass that he always wanted to be. And by that point.... my opinion on Kazami has changed 180 degrees than before.

So..... Would it be fair for me to liking Kazami and the character arc/development he went through throughout the show, but yet also agree that his initial characterization was incredibly unlikeable and even hating him for it back then (Since you know, that's the point of his character development)?",True,True,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,91996,public,spoiler,,,Just a thought I have regarding Kazami from Re:Rise...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/k1gpry/just_a_thought_i_have_regarding_kazami_from_rerise/,,all_ads,6,discussion,83f4319a-5fa5-11e7-8e79-0ec8348f5b38,Discussion,,,,,c029c72a-f8aa-11e3-ac67-12313d19304a,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am able to perceive newtypes as nothing more than a new way to control a war machine with more efficiency or in entirely new ways (Zeong's lazer arms, funnel system), however I feel like there's more to it, some weird message that I am unable to see. 

While it was bearable in Zeta and hardly bearable in CCA, Unicorn became a confusing mess, especially in the final battle. Characters keep talking stuff about something something other dimension beyond the time, something something understand each other, something something possibility. Also, the weird plot progression with visiting certain coordinates to... unlock more funny space magic for Unicorn (and excuses to sell more Unicorn gunplas?)? 

I sometimes can't enjoy some things without fully understanding them. This is one of the reasons why Iron-Blooded Orphans and Thunderbolt are my favorite series - they are easier to understand, partially because there is no space magic (TB perceives newtypes just as an increase of spatial awareness and a way to pilot Psycommu Zaku and that's it).

Also, I feel vastly inferior to other Gundam fans, because it's like I the anime was trying to say something right in my face, but I was too stupid to understand.

------------------------------------------------------

&gt; The Gelgoog series came as a response to the Federation’s advances in space, as Zeon was determined to turn the war back in their favor with mobile suits that could not only potentially replace the Zaku, but stand against the Federation’s new GM series and even the legendary Gundam. Despite the Principality’s eventual defeat, the result would still be one of the highest-performing mobile suits of the One Year War. Unsurprisingly, following the pattern of past Zeon efforts, numerous variants of the Gelgoog would be produced. 

-------------------------

##One Year War

##Initial Prototypes 

[**MS-06R-2 Zaku II High Mobility Type**](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/1/1c/R-3S.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150706225824)

&gt; Much like the Gouf and Dom, the development of what would eventually become the Gelgoog by the Zeonic company started from the shell of a Zaku - specifically one from the Zaku II High Mobility Type series of mobile suits, the [MS-06R-2 Zaku II High Mobility Type](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/e/e8/Zaku-ii-hmt-2-gff.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181007041218), of which only four units would be produced and were focused around the use of beam weaponry to counter the Federation's MS. 

&gt; The fourth of these particular units, originally piloted by ace pilot Elliot Rem, would be used as part of Zeonic's second phase into the *Main MS Development Plan* to produce a machine to act as the mainstay space-use mobile suit for Zeon's forces, which they failed to accomplish with the High Mobility Zaku series (and allowing the competing Zimmad company’s space-use MS-09R Rick Dom to take the spotlight for some time). It was quickly modified into a prototype designated as the **MS-06R-3S High Mobility Type Zaku** - due to its visual characteristics, it would also be known as the Gelgoog Early Type, although it is possible that the name was retroactively added some time after its creation.

&gt; The Gelgoog Early Type’s development was focused on the increase of the suit’s generator output that would allow it to handle beam weapons, much like how Zeonic had tried to do so before with the High Mobility Zaku. As a result of its increased power, it was the first suit to successfully employ a beam rifle, albeit with some technical difficulties still present at this stage. The Gelgoog Early Type was deployed for field-testing with the *Musai*-class light cruiser *Kuho Kam* at some point in October of UC 0079. 


[**YMS-14/MS-14S Gelgoog Commander Type**](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/6/6b/YMS-14_Gelgoog_Commander_Type_Gundam_Crisis_Front.png/revision/latest?cb=20201018000044)

&gt; Once plans were finalized for the Gelgoog to eventually become the Principality's new flagship unit in the war as the replacement of the Zaku, Zeonic would further develop the project and produce a total of twenty-five prototype units under the designation of **YMS-14**. Twenty-four of these machines would be handed to the Chimera Corps, a battalion of ace pilots founded and supervised by Kycilia Zabi.

&gt; The remaining unit was given out to Char Aznable - the Red Comet would first put the machine's capabilities to the test in October of UC 0079 against the Federation's legendary RX-78-2 Gundam, in which he demonstrated that the suit's great speed, thruster-powered mobility and power could not only match the Gundam, but even outmatch it (although at the expense of a thinner and less durable armor than the Gundam). The YMS-14 would later be dubbed as the [**MS-14S Gelgoog Commander Type**](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/5/55/GelgoogScan.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20121005150050) to serve as a high-performance machine for higher-ranking pilots like the communication antenna-equipped [MS-06S Zaku II Commander Type](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/7/74/Ms-06s-char.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140902162816) before it. 


##Mass Production 

[**MS-14A Gelgoog**](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/6/6e/Ms-14-igloo.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121113145629)

&gt; After the success of the YMS-14 prototype showcased by Char Aznable, Zeonic's crown jewel was put into mass-production (with some minor adjustments to increase durability at the slight expense of decreased speed) as the MS-14A Gelgoog. Carried over from the effort of the prototype units, the MS-14A would be the first of Zeon's mass-produced MS to employ beam weaponry thanks its powerful power output of 1440 kW (surpassing the MS-06F Zaku II's 951 kW and the MS-09R Rick Dom's 1199 kW) and the mass-produced form of the Gelgoog would still prove to be superior in all other aspects when compared to its other Zeon mass-produced predecessors. 

&gt; Instead of ballistic weaponry, the Gelgoog’s primary weapon was the powerful [Beam Rifle](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/4/41/Ms-14-beamrifle.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20201104140906), a refined version of what was tested in previous prototypes, which was based on data obtained by Zeon on mega-particle cannons of Federation warships powered by concentrated Minovsky particles. Instead of heat-based weapons, the Gelgoog uses the more effective [twin beam sword](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/7/7f/Ms-14-twinbeamsword.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120328141522), also called the beam naginata. Additionally, the Gelgoog used [an arm-mounted thick shield with anti-beam coating.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/b/b0/Ms-14-shield.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120328141504) 

&gt; Unfortunately for Zeon, despite the Gelgoog’s success as a high-performance production type mobile suit that could even take on the Gundam, its career within the Principality would be a short and inglorious one. In December of UC 0079, the Gelgoog was rushed off to defend the Principality’s last stronghold of A Baoa Qu only to be greatly outnumbered by the Federation’s RGM-79 GMs (as not enough Gelgoog units were produced in time to combat the Federation’s superior resources) and suffering from inexperience of rookie pilots in the cockpits of the MS-14A due to Zeon’s dwindling manpower. 


&gt; *Note : [The MS-17 Galbaldy α](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/e/e6/Galbaldy_%CE%B1_Analog.png/revision/latest?cb=20191213232513), one of Zeon's very last MS projects, is a combination of the MS-14 Gelgoog and YMS-15 Gyan - it was originally meant to be a successor to Zimmad's Gyan before it was rejected in favor of Zeonic's superior Gelgoog, thus the Galbadly then hastily incorporated design elements from it.*



##Early Specialized Variants 

&gt; Variants of the Gelgoog had already begun production even before the mass-produced MS-14A during the field-testing of the twenty-four YMS-14S prototype units assigned to the elite Chimera Corps. 

[**MS-14B Gelgoog High Mobility Type**](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/5/5f/Ms-14b.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180215104054)

&gt; Nine of the Chimera’s prototype units were converted to the MS-14B High Mobility Type (also called the B-Type, similar in concept to the Zaku High Mobility Type series due to its increased speed - this was possible because of the [thruster pack attached to the B-Type’s back](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/d/d1/Ms-14b-ridden-rear.png/revision/latest?cb=20121002183452), increasing the max acceleration rate from 0.84 G to 1.04 G. Additional B-Types were later produced and would participate in the defense of A Baoa Qu. 


[**MS-14C Gelgoog Cannon**](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/a/ab/Ms-14c.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121103221215)

&gt; As nine of the YMS-14S prototypes were converted into B-types, the remaining Chimera machines were retrofitted into the Gelgoog Cannon - the Gelgoog Cannon uses the same concept as [the Earth-based MS-06K Zaku Cannon](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/4/40/MS-06K.png/revision/latest?cb=20160613135509), replacing the ballistic 180mm Cannon with a backpack mounted RA-2 Beam Cannon as well as still being equipped with the B-Type's thruster pack (the energy that the MS can support due to the Gelgoog's inherently powerful reactor) - the thruster pack allowed to remain maneuverable to counter against the added weight of the mounted cannon that plagued the Zaku Cannon. Like the B-Type, more units would be later produced and fought at A Baoa Qu. 


##Late Specialized Variants

#Space-Types 

[**MS-14BR Gelgoog High Mobility R Type**](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/7/76/Vincent_BR.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141118084034)

&gt; The MS-14BR Gelgoog High Mobility R Type was a derivative of the B-type that certain members of the Chimera Corps would employ during the Battle of A Baoa Qu - only a handful of R Types were active during the OYW, but R Types would be used by Chimera members and mercenaries during incidents in the UC 0090s. The MS further improved the B-Type's speed and mobility by the added thrusters in the legs that resembled those of the [MS-06R-1A Zaku II High Mobility Type.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/f/ff/Zaku2-mobility-BO2.png/revision/latest?cb=20190317031950)

[**MS-14F Gelgoog Marine**](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/8/8f/MS-14F_Gelgoog_Marine.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20201110115651)

&gt; The MS-14F Gelgoog Marine was an improved variant of the MS-14A produced for Zeon's marine corps during the group's special missions during the OYW. Alongside stronger armor, the [distinct external propellant tanks on the MS-14F's back](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/5/5e/Ms-14f-rear.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121114185616) allowed it to remain in the fight longer.

&gt; Alongside the standard Gelgoog Beam Rifle, the Marine variant often utilized [the MMP-80 90mm Machine Gun](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/f/fc/Ms-06f2-mmp-80.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20201110114334) and two beam sabers instead of the beam naginata. 

&gt; The MS-14F would be most famously used by the renegade Cima Fleet during their involvement in Operation Stardust conducted by the Delaz Fleet in UC 0083 - [A Marine Commander Type](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/6/68/MS-14Fs_Gelgoog_Marine_Commander_Type.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20201101140954) existed, once used by Commander Cima Garahau during her leadership of the eponymous Cima Fleet.

[**MS-14Jg Gelgoog Jäger**](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/a/a2/MS-14Jg_Gelgoog_Jager.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121114182054)

&gt; The MS-14Jg Gelgoog Jäger was part of Zeon's United Maintenance Plan, a method introduced late into the OYW to streamline MS production by taking existing Zeon designs (Zaku, Dom, Gelgoog, Z'Gok) and creating overhauled, improved models (along with new MS). This resulted in not only the Gelgoog Jäger, but also machines like the Zaku II Kai, Z'Gok-E, Rick Dom II and the Kämpfer. 

&gt; The Jäger enhances the already impressive capabilities of the MS-14A Gelgoog, such as an increase in generator power to allow it heavier beam weapons such as [the Large Beam Machine Gun](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/8/87/Ms-14jg-beammachinegun.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120331141333) superior to the MS-14A's primary weapon - the MS-14Jg was naturally upgraded in maneuverability and speed, with a power output of 1490 kW and a max acceleration rate of 2.22 G. 

&gt; Like pretty much all resulting MS of the United Maintenance Plan, the Gelgoog Jäger was produced too late into the war to make any real difference and came out in limited numbers - some would be involved in attacks on Side 6 during a Zeon operation to uncover the RX-78NT-1 Gundam ""Alex"", but its post-OYW history is unknown. 


#Ground-Types

[**MS-14G Gelgoog Ground Type**](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/4/41/Ms-14gstandard.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140511021234)

&gt; Like the MS-06J Zaku II Ground Type, the MS-14G was a conversion of the MS-14A for ground-based combat on Earth and also referred to as the G-Type. It went through some minor modifications for this purpose, such the removal of parts originally meant for space usage for the MS-14A that weren't needed for the G-Type or the addition of built-in weapons that the space-type lacked. The handheld weapons remained largely the same aside from a larger [prototype beam rifle](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/a/a0/MS-14G_Commander_Battle_Operation.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20151216065021) the design of which was said to be modified to be turned into the [Beam Sniper Rifle used by the MS-05L Zaku I Sniper Type.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/2/2e/MS05L_-_HGDesignArt.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111216064845) It can be presumed that a very small number of MS-14Gs was produced. 

&gt; The [**MS-14GD Gelgoog G**](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/5/57/Ms-14gd.png/revision/latest?cb=20190629071234) was a minor variant of the G-Type that was intended for desert combat, but only eight units would produced to be sent to the African Front at the end of the OYW and patched up together with spare parts from the California Base (aside from heat-dissipating radiator backpack from the MS-06D Zaku Desert Type). 

&gt; The [MS-14D Desert Gelgoog](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/2/25/Ms-14d-uc.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140902170606) was curiously described as a variant of the MS-14A for desert and tropical environments that entered too late into the OYW to be mass-produced, and whose only combat record would be an attack on Torrington Base in UC 0096. It is possible that it was developed as a proper and improved follow-up to the Gelgoog G that never saw combat during the OYW. It possessed multiple features such as dust filters, cooling systems, thrusters and [backpack rocket boosters.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/6/66/Ms14d_p03.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160521135705)


-------------------------


##Post-One Year War Use 


&gt; The Gelgoog, just as the Zaku or Rick Dom, would find itself in use by Zeon remnants for years after the One Year War.

&gt; Like the [Zaku II Stutzer](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/e/e6/Ms-06f-stutzer.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120907130327) and the [Rick Dom Stutzer](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/3/3f/Rick-dom_stutzer.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100506081957), due to the inability to produce new MS, certain Zeon remnants fighting against the Titans' Black Otter team in the early 0080s used [a Gelgoog Stutzer](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/1/1b/Ms-14a-stutzer.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120812133907) equipped with [a winch unit over its body](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/b/b8/Ms-14-stutzer-thruster.gif/revision/latest?cb=20120106130318) that could serve multiple functions, such as throwing grenades, using shoulder-mounted missiles pods or minelayers and it could also carry weapons like bazookas.

&gt; Others would employ their remaining Gelgoog units as they were, which resulted in [some ](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/a/a1/MS-14A-Sleeves-front.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141113031948) being used by the Sleeves all the way in UC 0096 despite long since obsolete by the standards of the time.


[**MS-14J ReGelgu**](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/8/83/MS14J_ReGelg_-_Front.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111201064314)

&gt; The forces of the former Principality that had retreated to the asteroid base Axis at the end of the OYW were initially unable to produce new mobile suits and were forced to modify existing ones. Naturally, they looked towards upgrading the high-performance MS-14A Gelgoog units in their possession - this resulted in the superior ReGelgu, serving as the backbone of Axis' forces until new machines like the [mass-produced transformable AMX-003 Gaza-C.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/d/d5/AMX-003_Gaza-C_Front.png/revision/latest?cb=20200925130057)

&gt; Nevertheless, ReGelgu units would still participate in the First Neo Zeon War initiated by Haman Karn in UC 0088, such as one piloted by Second Lieutenant Illia Pazom. Surviving machines would be utilized in the hands of [the Sleeves](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/3/38/MS-14J-Sleeves-front.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141113032520) during the Laplace Incident in UC 0096 alongside their MS-14A predecessors. The ReGelgu included features such as the visually-distinctive thruster-equipped shoulder wings, as well as [a rear thruster pack.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/9/98/Ms-14j-back.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140912192155)

[**MS-14J/BR Gelgoog Vertex**](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/1/1d/MS-14JBR_Gelgoog_Vertex_-_Front.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200423163154)

&gt; Developed by Anaheim Electronics with assistance from the the Federation Survey Service from the ReGelgu and [visually similar to it](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gundam/images/7/70/MSVR-Johnny-Ridden-v17-RAW_embed0104.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200423183351), the Gelgoog Vertext was used Chimera Corps members during an incident in UC 0090.

Fair warning I’m on a lethal amount of caffeine and no sleep so heed the flair

Ok, so let’s start with the original build fighters series. First of all, there is literally a whole secondary reality/dimension and since Reiji can “Freely” travel between them that means there is actual dimensional travel between worlds. Crappy travel admittedly since it seems to be kind of funky, but still interdimensional travel non the less.

Additionally, there’s the plavsky particles and oh man where do you begin with these. Ok so first of all they can animate gunpla to become basically a real damn war machine. I know they say the particles only simulate the effects of the weapons, but you cannot deny that the real physical gunpla does get damaged. Now I’m just going to assume that the effects only work in a plavsky field which is fair given some of the stuff in fighters try, and yes, I’m going to get to that immersion bit in a damn second, that would’ve done some damage otherwise (that massive blast from burning into denial for example). Now if the plavsky stuff can demolish a gunpla and even destroy metal, sei mentions that he used metal parts in the build strike’s shield, just imagine what that can do to a human and now remember that this stuff is used like a children’s toy in the show that has absolutely nothing from stopping you from walking onto that big platform. Oh, and let’s not forget what happens when the plavsky particles get unstable. They crystalize and grow like a cancer and spread more particles! Which leads to a massive particle field where the Gundam effects can just exist and not to mention the fact that there is a chance that you can just get straight up crushed by those crystal formations. 

And if that wasn’t enough Plavsky based danger, you have the whole assimilation deal from build fighters try. Where if you get to invested in the game any damage your gunpla takes you feel like you took it! Shot, cut, stabbed, hell kits get vaporized and ripped apart in this show! Im not a medical professional, but I don’t think feeling any of that is going to be good for you. And it looks like you too can take the damage like a twisted voodoo doll if Sekai’s face cut is any indication.

Now to build divers. A video game can make literal A.I. Actual complex borderline living A.I. and the game just does it from excess data. A scientific achievement that is so complex that we haven’t even been able to do it yet and a video game just does it. Yeah that all I have to say for Divers, but re:rise is just… re rise is why I’m writing this.

First off, Re rise has canonical aliens and not just one, but three! There’s the eldoran furrys, the eldoran humans, and then the eldoran guardians. Canonical aliens! I guess 00 did it first but like at least they only had the one goop race. Speaking of the aliens, remember how Alus blew a whole into Eldora that made it to where hirito and the others couldn’t get into GBN. Yeah So that means that Eldora has a physical planet, obviously because you know the ender’s game everything is real twist, that means that on eldora hirito and the others are real and there gunpla. Hirito also has a gunpla (core2 with nepeight armor) and like user u/masteroftheharem pointed out this means that theoretically hirito could travel back in time thirty years. A video game invented not only A.I., not only lead to the discovery of three alien species, but also invented time travel in the most round about way possible! I’m sorry but that maybe the most insane thing that just gets glossed over. However, I guess it’s a good thing that it didn’t get addressed because Alus could probably do it to and just wipe out the earth with an army of his fake grunts. 

This series is insane when you look into the crap in implies. Ok to end this I just wanted to say that this post was just for fun, so take it with a grain of salt. But I mean come on, this is just ridiculous if really look at it.

So I'm watching the last 8 dubbed, and when it comes to Newtypes, I'm not sure if they are previously discussed in the dub, or if it immediately becomes the major plot point after Lalah joins Char in space?

They mentioned it one or two times in the sub as a new discovery, but now by episode 42, Char and Shayla are getting spidey sense?

Do Newtypes activate each other, and was that something the dub covered that the sub didn't? 

Or did testing Lalah confirm it for Zeon, while the Federation still doesn't understand it?

Further with the Aznables, there's the masks, the sub-plot where they pretend to be someone else.

Let's take UC universe as an example. I would argue what usually make a UC gundam show feels real is not how realistic the science and technology are in the universe, but rather its portrayal of war, humanity and society. The nature of the war and the flow of the situation are generally pretty logical in these shows. Wars happen when there's a conflict of interest. Those in power, if left unchecked, would be corrupted and abuse their power. It's nothing revolutionary in the portrayal of the overarching narrative, but it's a good reflection of events that had happened in real world. On a macro scale, these shows is extremely realistic.

Of course, one thing that Gundam is know for is its characters' eccentric nature. How can a show be considered realistic when the characters would do the most insane thing imaginable?  Sure, many characters would often do batshit crazy things in Gundam, however, none of their individual action has a profound impact on how the war progress. Gundam characters might be crazy or even have psychic power, but they are still people. People are just people and nothing more. They can't singlehandedly save the day or turn the tide of the war. Everyone is just a part of the society, and it takes a society to truly make a difference. I personally think a realistic Gundam often embrace this idea pretty well.  

Furthermore, in Gundam, there usually isn't any single character that symbolizes an objective truth. No character is a larger than life representation of an ideal. Everyone is simply fighting for what they believe in. While some characters are definitely more morally correct than other, none of them is flawless and represents an absolute truth.

I often find people get hung up on all the new type power/super weapon during argument, but I think we has been arguing about the wrong thing altogether. In my opinion, what make a real robot real is how it portrays its characters in relation to the society. It's not about how realistic a single character is, nor is it about how close to real world is the technology used in the show. 

What motivated me to write is because I saw a lot of people on this sub arguing that Gundam has never been real because there are new type space magic and super weapon from the very first Gundam.

One of the reasons I feel its obscurity is undeserved is that it has a stigma, that being ""kids show."" I know there are a sizable portion of gundam fans who prefer it when crying teenagers stay as far away from the robots as possible and also do not like watching shows where it is about children playing with plastic toys, they like serious shows that show off the brutality of war and conflict. The thing is that just because Gundam Age is meant for younger audiences doesn't mean that it isn't about just that. Gundam Age is not a lighthearted show, plenty of really f\*cked up stuff happens in it and a lot of characters die. Being a kid's show just means there will not be intense gore,overt references to sex, and excessive fan service. A good example of how a show can be serious yet still be for children is Avatar the Last Airbender, a show which dealt with topics such as war, genocide, anger issues, and much more while all being lighte hearted and meant for children. Both shows are made for children, but they are not brought down by that fact.

The other reason that I feel it is unjustly passed over for is the third protagonist, Kio Asuno. Kio is notoriously a pacifist, a major turn off for many. Personally speaking (very important, this is my personal opinion) this never bothered me, it almost did but in the end it did not. The reason I found him to be alright is the specific context his character is in. Kio wants to end a war that has been raging since the time his grandfather was his age, he does not want to perpetuate this cycle of violence so he attempts to do something about it. Is he handled as well as other pacifist protagonists like Banagher and Loran? No, but I still do not think he was handled poorly.

Those two things I really find are unjust reasons to pass up on Gundam Age, but unfortunately there are really good reasons to do so, and the main one is that Gundam Age does not give many reasons to watch it.

Gundam Age falls into a category I like to call ""Just More Gundam,"" that being Gundam works that while adequate or even good are just not nearly as interesting or standout, they are just the same gundam experience you have already gotten from better shows. Alongside Gundam Age in this category I have placed: After War Gundam X, Victory Gundam, and ZZ Gundam. I like all of these shows, but I cannot recommend them to anyone outside of those who want to see everything that is Gundam. Gundam Age is probably my highest ranked in this category but even for as much as i like it I cannot overlook its flaws. The first arc sucks badly and could/should have been shortened down to 2-4 episodes. Some ideas are opened up but never go anywhere. The pacing is sometimes really bad, especially near the end. The final boss fight is out of nowehre. And most tragically of all there are SOOOO many extraneous or underdeveloped characters. That really sucks since the characters is often the primary pillar of Gundam shows and what makes them interesting.

It's a real shame I can't tell more people to watch it, after all the show does have some really good ideas, mobile suits, and characters, most notably Asemu Asuno and Zehart Galette, both of whom are among my favorite gundam pilots and char clones respectively. The Gundams are really f\*cking cool, especially the Legilis, and the concept of a decades long war fought by entire generations of people is such a fascinating concept. I just wish Gundam Age could have done more to differentiate itself from other gundam shows and give people a reason to see it.

I particularly enjoy the writing for season 2 even though the main criticism I've seen is that some character arcs don't get fleshed out enough and that the pacing sort of wanes in the middle of the season (it hasn't for me, and I've just finished the Mobile Armor Arc). I like that the writing has been able to make it clear to even my ADD ass where each faction stands and how the pieces are being maneuvered between Tekkadan, Gjallarhorn, and the fracturing economic blocs. 

This is all without even speaking about the fights. It's surprising to me how well animated the fights in season 2 are so far, since I was expecting fights to be a lot slower and tactics driven a la season 1. But seeing mobile suits move like mobile suits is, in a word, exhilarating. The writers do a phenomenal job (in my opinion) of writing characters in a world where the viewer can believe that they can handle their machines the way that they do. A character either has the AV system or they don't. If they do, the viewer can tell by how they move. If they don't have the AV and can just move that well, the viewer can discern that the pilot is incredibly smart and phenomenally skilled at handling their mobile suit, regardless of have savage and thuggish the pilot may appear. Good implicit character building for me. Vidar Rising is a particular standout for me.

Anyways, my question is what series do I have to go to next to get just...more of this

**tl;dr** \- As my first Gundam Series, IBO has become one of my all time fav anime series period...where do y'all recommend I go next? 

**sidenote** \- let me just say how amusing it is finally watching a gundam series beginning to end and seeing how much the SRW games borrow from this series. Very cool seeing the ""personalities"" of each group have a custom frame -- gundam or no -- that makes them stand out in battle. And it makes each scene where someone who the viewer knows is a skilled pilot walks up to their superior like ""Please sire, let me Pilot the X-7 Blazing BS...CUSTOM"" incredibly hype. Love the drama lol.

Personally, I’d love to see a new Gundam Breaker game sometime in the future, with all of the available model kits and maybe a few more newly released since NGB—but with the customisation and mechanics from GB3, maybe with a little polish, but other than that, isn’t that really all we’d want? A decent story, of course, but basically keeping all of the customisation, utilisation and gameplay of GB3, with all new model kits and what not on top of it?

Mind you, I’ve only seen reviews and heard people talk about GB3 and NGB, and while I would want to get NGB for some model kits available in it that isn’t available in GB3, I’d find the acquisition of these kits to be more of a pain than it needs to be. 

But I am sure it’s clear to Bandai Namco that the first game they develop in a beloved series has pretty much flopped. GB3 is still about $30+ at the cheapest, and I found NGB for about $10. I can see either one of three outcomes—they either let the previous developer make future titles, completely scrap the notion of making any further Gundam Breaker games, or just double down and keep making it with all the things people have complained about and just not release the game in the West again, attributing the loss to the game being sold worldwide. 

I can probably see the third happening, but I just hope they go the way of the first.

1) There is often very little subtlety and too much exposition.  Characters just non-stop engaging in either philosophical rants or aggressive appeals to other characters.  This makes dialogue painful at times, whether dubbed or subbed, and makes male protagonists in particular both cliche and annoying at the same time.

2) Some series tend to be more like ""super robot"" instead of ""real robot"", making it more like a kids show and not the adult audience.

As an old person now, I appreciate SEED so much more and was surprised to read so many negative posts/comments (especially considering it's the first or second most popular series in Japan).

SEED delivers excellent melodrama and portrays many different and complex relationships. It encompasses the overarching theme of the consequences of war and extremism in a very human drama. The emotional buildup and attachment to the characters throughout the story was well done and made character deaths and touching moments very impactful and satisfying. I cried and got chills at many points in the series. 

Animation was excellent. I saw many complaints of stock footage being used, but SEED is way better than many other anime. The HD remaster was done well, although I didn't care for the extra boob/nipple and ass shots.

The OST is bar none top of its class. Vivian Hsu, TM Revolution, Tamaki Nami, Nakashima Mika, Yuki Kajiura. The extended endings were beautiful, especially FIND THE WAY in ep 44 and 48. (River was removed from the HD remaster, but I still gave it some love on my playlist).

Flay is one of the most interesting characters in a TV show. I saw most people saying they hate her b/c she's a crazy bitch, but her psychological journey is what makes her so interesting. After growing (much) older and having all kinds of relationships with people, I really appreciate how SEED portrayed a broken abusive relationship.

Flay, Cagalli, and Lacus are notable foils to each other. All three are daughters of country leaders whose fathers die, yet they are all drastically different. Flay and Cagalli are both sensitive and emotionally driven, yet Flay discards morality to (quite effectively) encourage the destruction of everyone else, while Cagalli clings to her principles despite her actions being practically useless. Cagalli and Lacus are both rebels, but the former haphazardly follows her emotions without direction while the later is a logical strategist.

Lacus is another character that I loved despite most people here discounting her as a useless ""Mary Sue."" Throughout the series, Lacus recognizes that her decisions and actions are not necessarily the ""correct"" one. The scene where Athrun confronts her at the theatre was one of her most impactful monologues, especially the moment where she changes from sweet Lacus to ""angry"" Lacus asking Athrun if he killed Kira, if he is fighting to get medals and the approval of his father, and if he wants to shoot her. Without moments like that she would have been a very bland character. Also, honorable mention for the touching moment of her singing to the kids during the Junius meteor shower.

There is so much more to say about SEED, but I'll keep it short.

As for Destiny... there isn't much I would say to defend SEED's sequel. I'm aware of the alleged problems behind the scenes. As a fan of SEED, Destiny serves its purpose to provide additional content and action with the SEED crew. 

The new Destiny cast, especially Shinn, are mostly insufferable. Destiny is mostly a rehash of SEED, just switching out genocide vs genocide for genocide vs fascist oppression. The dialogue does make it seem like all the characters lost 50 IQ points. When Kira &amp; the Archangel got back into action, it was a lot more tolerable, but Destiny overall fails at generating emotional investment and impact, probably because most of the plot points are rehashes (from Kira's Gundam being destroyed to the attempts at nuclear genocide). The clip monologue episodes also ruined the pacing of the show.

Anyways, binging SEED &amp; Destiny really brightened my past two weeks in these COVID times.

I’m season 1, Barbatos fights the monstrous Graze Ein whilst Gaelio and his knight like Kimaris duel McGillis in an agile suit with twin gold blades. Cut to season two and we have Barbatos Lupus Rex fighting the direct successor to the Ein in the form of the new Reginlaze Julia. At the same time, Gaelio’s Kimaris returns to its knight-like appearance to duel McGillis in an agile Gundam frame with twin gold swords. The difference being that the victors are reversed.

Turns out [gundam](https://www.history.com/topics/1960s/1968-events) was inspired by historical events. Makes sense, we can see a lot of ww2 influence, vietnam influence, so on.  


Why am I bringing this up?  


The Zaku 1 was developed in less then a decade. We have a life size gundam currently in Japan. Japan has a history of making these life size replicas, except this newest one is designed to move.  


This is after Japan and America had two war machines duke it out in a warhouse, almost destroying a wall and some very expensive lighting systems.   


My point, is we are incredibly close to actually having the tech for this stuff, and we are well within the time range for developing these further.  


Modern energy tech is getting more advanced and easier to make, using less rare earth materials. The only problem now, is the actuators and tensile strength of materials.   


There are a lot of things we need to work on, but to get a working Zaku 1? or even a prototype Mobile worker? hell we have the tech to make Balls right now. All it is is an armored shuttle pod. The biggest thing about Gundam, is their development timelines. We are usually seeing the finalized products in the anime, realistically speaking, we have the technology to begin research and development.

One person (a Gundam fan) decided to get his anime club members (non-mecha anime viewers) to watch Re:Rise season 1. The guy gave his friends a Build Divers cheat sheet so they'd have context, and they mostly liked it, but the thing that shocked me and the people in that thread was these people thought the show was **dense.** Here's the exact quote:

&gt;However, one loud complaints I've heard from them is that ReRise is so dense to watch that 23 minute episode feel like 45.   
&gt;  
&gt;Many of them struggle to keep up and had to parse the episodes sometimes by half at a time.  

This is the complete opposite of what I felt while watching S1. I felt the show was dragging its heels getting to obvious conclusions, although it managed to subvert by going in a totally different direction than what I expected. The people in that thread also had that assessment, and were trying to figure out why there was such a huge gulf in opinion. There seemed to be a consensus that as scifi/mecha fans, they were more comfortable with shows that drop you in a world/scenario and expect you to learn as you go, plus as a sequel, they were already familiar with BD's setting and likely story progression.

***MS-06D Zaku Desert Type:***

***Color-*** desert camo (broad defined camo), or desert color.

***Head type-*** The two-antennae type or the single-antenna type... Leaning towards a two antenna type.

***Close Combat Weapons-*** Garma's heat hawk (A friend gave me), double-sided heat hawk, or Gouf heat saber.

***Primary Firearm weapon-*** The ZIM/M.T-K175C 175mm Recoilless Rifle, or the MMP-80 90mm Machine Gun, or the M-120AS 120mm Machine Gun... Many mixed emotions here...

***Left Arm Secondary Weapon-*** 3-tube Missile Launcher, or knuckle shield(I don't want it to overpowered), or 3-barrel 35mm Machine Gun with a Gouf Gatling shield (most likely but would be very overpowered).

***Auxiliary weapons*** Triple Missile Pod on legs, two of the variant Hand Grenade (smoke or flash and a standard) worn at the waist (this instead of SA-712 Cracker Grenade at waist), and obviously the head mounted 40mm Vulcan Gun will be there.

***Appearance notes-*** Will definitely be using a spiked right shoulder shield, will maybe have a poncho like throw, will likely have a spiked left shoulder.

Unlike GBF which characters have colorfull hair colors, and have attractive  characters especially the females (which i dont have any problems with)

one other point is the MC in GPBG had an original gunpla design unlike in GBF which the MC customize his gunpla based on an existing gunpla

overall i liked and enjoyed both series. GBF btw is what makes me start collecting gunpla again😝

GPBG

\-build your gunpla and put hard work into it like scratch build parts, custom paint, coat it etc.

\-just scan your gundam and it will apear in the simulation, your gunpla will not be destroy irl during battle.

\-sit in cockpit like simulation machine and wear cool mobiles suit pilot outfit

GBF

\-painstakingly customize or build your gunpla from scratch.

\- gunpla moves on its own which is cool but in battle simulation but gets destroy irl during battle and have to repair your gundam everytime its destroyed or damaged and joints may loose overtime from too much moving

\-cool hologram booth but can only stand on your legs until who knows when the battle ends

However now I am looking to find a link for MS Zeta Gundam episodes. Do you have any links that can take me to all of these episodes? OR better yet, any suggestions on how I can access ALL of the Gundam series online? Basically I am a super binge watcher and I want to really get deep after seeing what I have. Even if I have to pay online I would like to access all the available Gundam series, and at least right now, the MS Zeta Gundam episodes.

I also already have Crunchyroll so what is available on there I can see. However I have not seen MS Zeta Gundam on there at all as well as some apparently key movies.

The largest number I have seen for a non-mass produced units, per official designations, is the GM Ground Type (officially a 'preproduction' unit, likely due to using a large number of parts salvaged from Project V), sitting in the 40-50 range, which seems to include the handful of Sniper Ground Types we see.

Probably a stupid question, but it has been on my mind for quite a while and I can't understand it. 

Why do Gundam pilots in anime say their name and the MS identification before a fight? I only watched Unicorn, 00 and IBO but in 00 it happens all the time. I can kinda understand why they would do it before deploying, but there are moments when everything stops and Setsuna (for example) goes:

""This is Setsuna in Gundam Exia and I will now kill you""

Or in IBO final episode both Mika and Akihiro stop for a while,  do a dramatic pose and present themselves. I mean, their enemies know who they are fighting, don't they? Actually, is this message broadcast to everyone nearby or do they just say it to each other on comms?

My first introduction to the series as a kid was the Zeonic Front game. Playing through it again while watching the anime I noticed that both governments just suuuuck. On one side you have a super corrupt and often incompetent Earth Feds who are just assholes, and on the other side you have the also super corrupt and very often incompetent Zeon who took a revolution and turned it into a genocidal mess. 

Still, the spacenoids do believe in their cause, independence from the Federation and the be free of their bull. I can imagine that several people on earth and not just the sides would be done with the Feds bullshit. I mean, yeah sure, I'm positive that most of Zeon's earthbound sympathisers jumped off that band wagon when that colony was dropped but hey, there still might have some die-hards, apologists, and/or deniers. 

Anyway, my question is were there any Earth born and raised soldier or pilot who sided with Zeon? Either defectors or civilians who willingly joined up with them once the invasion began? Specifically in the one year war period and not every other bajillion Fed-Zeon war. I'm sure there were probably a few Zeon defectors who jumped ship first chance they got if they heard about the Colony drop, buy being that the Feds are the good guys I'm not sure that the writers would have it the other way around.

Reasons why Jerid is rad:

* Has a huge set of balls to ask out his mentor who's already dropkicked him in the face and criticized his arrogance. As they say, nice guys finish last with the ladies and Jerid is not a nice guy
* Dude was not afraid of battling one of the most powerful Newtype freaks in the UC timeline over and over and even had multiple opportunities to kill the wunderkind if it wasn't for interference. Again, beach ball sized nuts on this guy
* Gets thrown off Mount Kilimanjaro with a busted leg and shrugs it off as if it was a splinter
* Super suave ass hair that just exudes confidence
* Got rid of a radically unstable Cyber Newtype before she could do more harm to anyone around her
* Immediately puts the smooth moves on Mouar when she revealed her affection and didn't pussyfoot around like some timid ass nerd
* Doesn't care about petty destruction of property or needing to sacrifice his comrades, he sees the big picture
* Out of like the 2 or 3 times the Titans actually won a battle against the AEUG, one of them (Operation Apollo) had Jerid leading the charge for Lt Scirroco against both Kamille AND Quattro to keep them occupied
* He goes from just a hot shot test pilot to being a body guard for the freaking leader of the Titans 
* Probably hates Newtype shenanigans as much as Gundam fans do (despite becoming one)

The inclusion of free jazz/oldies was a great more experimental choice than your typical jpop/dance influenced Gundam soundtrack.

It was just reenactments of memorable battles from throughout the series, but with no overarching story to chain those reenactments together. I was expecting crazy crossover shenanigans where the characters meet and interact, and all the plots and settings get mashed together, something like Super Robot Wars or Dynasty Warriors Gundam. But each stage is self-contained, can be played in mostly any order, and no one ever acknowledges the presence of your units who show up out of nowhere with no explanation as soon as the battle begins.

Apparently the ""story"" in that game is just that you're debugging some kind of program, the units you use are representative of your debugging/antivirus tools, and the units that show up where they don't belong (like 00, AGE, and SEED characters and suits showing up during Amuro's first battle in the Gundam) are representative of bugs in the program, and none of what's happening is actually ""real""? Ehh, personally I just can't get behind a story like that. I don't really like when crossover games use the ""it's just a simulation/all the characters are clones or illusions instead of the real thing/ect"" angle. I want the characters I'm controlling and the stuff I'm seeing to be ""real"", if that makes any sense.

Apparently the game is also primarily a big grindfest too. It seems there's not actually that many stages, and the bulk of the game is spent grinding money to buy the characters and suits you want, and then levelgrinding to upgrade them so that you can play the harder stages with them. While I am aware that this kind of thing appeals to a lot of people, it's just not my thing. I would prefer a more ""natural"" and ""organic"" progresson that requires little, if any, grinding.

But I think there are enough hints to put together a reasonable guess.  


Paptimus Scirocco is the ""Man from Jupiter"". Jupiter is the Roman name for Zeus, the ruler of the Greek/Roman pantheon. Sirocco is the name of a a major wind in the Mediterranean area. The Palace Athene is a ""corruption"" of Pallas Athena, an alternate name of the goddess of war Athena, the daughter of Zeus. The ""O"" is said to mean the ""Will of God"" which can be taken as either the prefix of ""o"" in Japanese is used for reverence or respect. So ""The O"" could be ""the ultimate reverence"" (God). The O could also refer to Olympus because that is where Zeus rules form. 

So we have a self-identified god that wants to take over the Titans. Zeus is the one that led the rebellion against and killed the Greek/Roman titans.  So, essentially we have a whole bunch of stuff that ties Scirocco to the Greek, Roman and Mediterranean culure.  


Where does the Gabthley come in? I propose that the Gabthley is a corruption of ""Gadfly"". What is a Gadfly? Well, I am glad you asked. A gadfly is the name given to a couple of stinging/biting insects, quite notably the horsefly, which are large, agile and drink blood, not unlike a mosquito. This part is important because the Japanese name  ガブスレイ has 2 parts  ガブ (gabu) and  スレイ (srei). A rough translation of  ガブ (gabu) is  a sort of onomatopoeia for guzzling or drinking, like a mosquito would do. The Gabthley transforms into a very insect looking MA. It carries the rifle "" Fedayeen "" which 

What else is a Gadlfy? Well, lets go back to mythology. A gadfly is sent to bother Io, a mortal lover of Zeus, by Hera. So, there some connection to Zeus there. Scirocco sends the Gabthley to torment the Argama, the successor to the Pegasus class. In Mythology, a gadfly is sent to stop a hero riding Pegasus from reaching and overthrowing Mount Olympus.

So....what else? Argama can also mean ""Tradition"" in Sanskrit. In political science terms, a gadfly is someone who interferes with the status quo. Or tradition. The tradition of the Gundam being the winner and savior of Earth.

So, knowing Gundam's propensity to have names mean many things across languages, I say that the Gabthley is a tormenter, a maneuverable and deadly insect, sent from the would be ruler of Earth and the Titans, to destroy the staus quo.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,89374,public,self,,,Thoughts about Gabthley (name and lore stuff),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/jf05w6/thoughts_about_gabthley_name_and_lore_stuff/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here goes:

###

I’ve been a big fan of Mobile Suit Gundam since I was a teenager. Well, at least a fan of the original film trilogy, which I had bought when one gratuitously overpriced anime DVD every few months was all that my allowance could afford. For the longest time, though, those three films and Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory (thanks to its Adult Swim timeslot) were all I’d seen. Zeta always loomed over my fandom, with its revered status in the fandom as the “serious one”, taunting me as if I could never call myself a true fan until I’d seen Tomino’s masterpiece.

Now in my thirties, nearly half my life stands as the distance between myself and those teenage years as a Gundam fan. And finally, I can say that I’ve watched the Zeta Gundam, with my own jaded adult eyes. And while I still think I prefer the original, I’ve collected some thoughts along the way:

Familiar Friends

The most thrilling parts of Zeta for me, initially, were the parts that already held some familiarity from the original series. Of course, we encounter Lt Quatro (Char’s new persona) and Bright Noah early in the series.

Bright’s ever-stoic presence provides continuity, but Char’s presence was more interesting. In the original story, he spends much of his time subtly undermining the leaders of Zeon while establishing himself as Amuro’s chief rival. In this series, though, he’s an ally of good, joining the Anti-Earth forces in their battle against the corrupt and powerful Titans. Here, Char is not so much an extremist, but a somewhat wizened and war-weary soul. Amuro, by contrast, is totally done with warfighting and piloting Mobile Suits. He shines during a few moments, but mostly lives as a recluse, under constant surveillance by the Earth Federation. As a hero, Amuro was always kind of apolitical, and that’s true here, too. He does what he can to help his friends currently fighting against the Titans, but does not seem all that concerned with the way the world has shaped around him since the Federation’s victory in the original series. I have to say, watching as an adult, I really liked Amuro’s role in Zeta Gundam. It felt relatable, as an adult who has also settled into a place in the world that is perhaps a bit less full of romantic heroism than I once dreamed it would be. In the end, I really did think that Amuro was a nice surrogate for Zeta’s adult audience.

There are other cameos were nice – but really amounted to little more than fan service. And while it was nice that Zeta allowed us to see where most of the MSG characters ended up after the One Year War, nearly all stayed somewhere in the backdrop, aside from Char. So, what about the new stuff?

Kamille, the AEUG, and the Titans

As a direct sequel to Mobile Suit Gundam, I admit I found Zeta to be a bit confusing. Over 5 years after the end of the One Year War, so much has changed. At first glance, there’snot much about Z that seems to lead directly from MSG, and that took some getting used to. Who are the AEUG? Who are the Titans? How are they different than the Federation? Why are the Titans using Zeon-like Mobile Suits while the AEUG are using, uh… Federation AND Zeon type suits? There are answers to all these questions, but in many cases, they are answers that you will not find if you just rely on the show’s own storytelling. The picture eventually become clear to me, but for a while, it was just tough to keep track of it all.

As far as Kamille goes, contrary to a lot of people’s reactions, I liked him quite a bit. I felt like he was similar to the OG Amuro, but with a little bit more of a cynical edge. Sure, his motivations for joining the AEUG aren’t very good, but he passes the authenticity test as a “moody teen”. His interactions and emotional arcs with his crewmates never feel fully developed and I feel like a lot of interesting stuff was left on the cutting room floor – but honestly, I would say the same thing about the original series. All of this is disappointing, but forgivable.

The titan villains are where I found the show generally to be far weaker than the original. Jerid is a far, far cry from Char. His cyber newtype girlfriends who Kamille kills one after another are not very interesting. For most of the action, it seemed like the show was unable to commit to a villain, and instead felt a lot more serialized than I would have expected, i.e., “new week, new villain”. The original worked this way too, but I feel like each stop villain had a lot more personality than the ones in Zeta – with a more distinct personality and more discernable mobile suit.

Things improve dramatically, I thought, when the remnants of Zeon show up. These villains have some personality, and the way our “heroes” come to grips one-by-one with the fact that their fight has led them to a morally grey alliance with the heirs to Zeon is easily one of the more interesting plotlines. The show also leaves off, surprisingly, with the story just getting good.

In Conclusion

Zeta Gundam was an interesting watch for me, so many years later in life from when I originally encountered the series. Was it an improvement on the original? In some ways, sure… in other ways, perhaps I felt like it’d been surpassed by later OVA’s which have taken Tomino’s themes and best ideas and spun them into works that are a little bit more even and consistent. But that’s OK! In the end, Zeta Gundam was easily compelling enough to set the stage for an entire Univeral Century’s worth of sequels, OVA’s, and tie-ins.

Basically it states that he saw an ""exhausted foe barely able to fight on for much longer"" (use of quotations meant to paraphrase the general meaning, not an actual quote). This is despite both sides having already lost billions of lives in the war, the Earth Federation having effectively lost most if not all of its space-faring navy (and thus being in just as bad a position militarily as Zeon if not more so), and the Earth Federation having an overall far less competent or even technologically capable military.

When Zeon realized that the Earth wasn't going to surrender because of this very speech by General Revil, they initiated the invasion of Earth itself, causing massive infrastructural damage and casualties among civilians (even when not directly targeted), wrecking much of what had survived the One Week War's (the initial week of the war where use of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons was widespread) Operation British in Europe, Asia, and North America. This further retarded whatever economical and population recovery could have been made after the devastation of the colony drop on Australia, lengthened an already horrid war from one week to around a year, and directly led to the instability of the Earth Sphere for decades if not over a century.

All because an old man wanted to continue a war that had already cost the lives of billions, that would require the Earth Federation to fight a war of attrition against Zeon that would cost even more millions. His reasoning? He saw a very small subsection of the Zeonic military that was recovering from battles. Something that all units have to do after extended action of the field, or by not doing so render themselves not capable of fighting at all, even in the most well-supplied armies. His desire to continue the fight, one could even call it warmongering, led to decades of instability, repression, war, and economic depression.

Round 2 both in their final gundams: Amuro in the Nu gundam vs Kira in the strike freedom.

Round 3 final suits fully loaded: nu gundam with H.W.S. and double fin funnel vs strike freedom with meteor unit.

My thoughts on the fight, I'm giving round 1 to Kira, imo the strike is so much more versatile than the gundam.

Round 2 to Amuro, the Nu gundam thoroughly outclasses the strike freedom and combine with the fact that in his final battle Amuro has had WAY more combat experience than Kira.

Round 3 I honestly think could go either way, nu gundam's extra weapons and double fin funnel set up makes it pretty broken, but likewise the meteor unit essentially turns strike freedom into a mobile armor.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,88924,public,self,,,"Three round battle between Amuro Ray &amp; Kira Yamato, the OG vs space Jesus.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/jajn5y/three_round_battle_between_amuro_ray_kira_yamato/,,all_ads,6,discussion,83f4319a-5fa5-11e7-8e79-0ec8348f5b38,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wanted to go ahead and share it with you guys because I felt it adds to the backstory and mysteries, even possible answers, to the universe of the Correct Century and its Dark History.

SYSTEM-A99 Turn-A Gundam:  
Any type of physical attack will not damage its armour, plus any type of ammunition, shock, to beam weaponary will all be deflected by its I-field. Has the ability to teleport, as well as warping its attacks such as warping a beam particle shot to move directly into an enemy cockpit. The beam rifle, at maximum power, can be stronger than a mega particle cannon to even a colony laser. 

The Moonlight Butterfly, at 20% output, could cover and ultimately destroy Earth's surface and civilization. But if at 100% output, the Moonlight Butterfly can cover everything from Earth to Jupiter. 

Turn A's chest's multipurpose silo can summon weapons (it can only ""summon"" stuff from Earth, and apparently it can only be done with special devices made specifically for the Turn A).

The teleportation system makes it possible for, as long as there are nanomachines available at all, to regenerate everything entirely, including the pilot. This is done by the teleportation system apparently ""saving"" the status of the machine and everything in it and sending it somewhere. The nanomachines can use that data to regenerate everything; depending on how much needs to be regenerated, it could take even ages to complete. Complete regeneration is said to take thousands of years.

Uses DG cell technology 

Is said to be meant to be piloted by Newtypes. Newtypes are said to have left the Earth sphere. 

The Turn A's hands are so sensitive they can be used to pick up a regular human-sized bucket of water. 

The 1320 meter attack use satellite Keilas Guilie can't even scratch the Turn A.

It could take control of any mobile weapon remotely (Turn X too). 

Turn A's power source is a DHGCP type ultracompact fusion reactor, which include two degeneracy engines. 

The I-field beam drive system creates a film of particles to move, hence why the machine is hollow; there is no need for that of motors and such. 

Turn A is created to carry out entire operations on its own (unlike other conventional weapons which are created just to fulfill certain roles) 

I-field works on physical ammunition and shocks as well as beams. 

Extremely powerful, as it was made to fight gigantic space battleships. 

The beam sabers uses electromagnetic fields and focuses them with plasma to cut through anything. 

Gundam Hammer: The I-field could be connected to the Gundam hammer itself, and in the process, become a more dangerous weapon to its enemy.

The multipurpose silo was originally meant for beam cannon drive units, missile systems, machine guns, other short-range weapons, additional power and so on. 

System Í: It is unknown what ""System A"" actually refers to, but some think it has something to do with all of the technology and weapons the Turn-A has.

DOC Base: Standing for device operation control base: it is a tactical system location which weapons and equipment for the Turn-A to use to overturn conventional mobile suit operation. It is unknown how many sites are there, but the one seen was affected by the Moonlight Butterfly attack, and therefore the weapons were destroyed.

7th-GMPT: Standing for ""7th generation Minovsky particle theory"", it refers to the type of energy the Turn-A is powered by.

Interesting to note; the Dark History-era Turn A had something else (not a beam saber) in its right saber rack. What it was is unknown. 

The Moonlight Butterfly can be projected in front of the Turn A to create a barrier. 

All of this was because they were considering the possibility of expanding the scale of battle in Turn. More evidence of this can be seen in other materials from around the same time, and the novelization is based on the materials from that time. 

The Turn A warps the beams from its rifle and snipes at targets from all directions, effectively executing all-range attacks without any funnel-type weapons. 

Other/Random Turn A Info:  
The Turn A's head is pretty much a whole ton of sensors tossed together. Control of the nanomachines is also in the head. 

Control of the machine is carried out by the pilot, but also by the spine impulse sensors in the seat which pick up the pilot's will. 

Optional hangers on the back can hold beam rifles and shields and so on. If needed, it can choose equipment inside a DOC Base. Stuff can also be equipped on the latches on the forearm. 

Turn A was meant to be the ultimate mobile weapon. 

In Turn A, the DG cells were later researched and used for various peaceful purposes, including their original one of healing the Earth's environment. The new DG cells included an apotheosis program to prevent evolution, regeneration and growth outside of their purpose. The nanomachines in Turn A are in other words the descendants of the DG cells, which brought a great paradigm shift to mankind, but also led them to self-destruction. 

In the Turn A novelization and Turn A Gundam Record Collection 2 there is mention of a terrorist attack involving spreading a virus through nanomachines causing them to attack mankind and bring civilization to its feet, a veritable second DG cell crisis

Turn A variations:

System-Í98 Prototype Turn-A Gundam: Also known as the testbed Í. Has a different chest structure and a head more strongly resembling the Turn X's, and its cockpit is in the head. 

Mass Production Turn-A Gundam: A mass production model of the Turn A with some features excluded. Seen briefly in the comic version, Has nothing to do with the mass production White Doll that Guin Lineford was planning to make. 

Sumo Gundam: An early idea by Syd Mead, also known as the ""M Version"". Its a Sumo with a Gundam face hiding behind the face cover. Was once modelled by Dengeki Hobby Magazine and painted in traditional Gundam colours. There is no official setting for this design, but some references to it exist (for example, it is mentioned how the Turn A and Sumo's cockpits are compatible). 

CONCEPT-X 6-1-2 Turn-X:  
(Concept-X Project-6 Division-1 Block-2)  
A mysterious MS found in a mountain cycle on the moon, with many things in common with the Turn A: Turn-X is supposed to mean ""the one who strayed (turned) from the path at the tenth (X = 10) planet or star"".

It's origin and history is unknown, but several theories exist: one theory is that it was a machine made for interstellar travel, maybe also to be piloted by Newtypes, that somehow drifted in space and found its way to Earth. The Earthnoids, scared that such technology could exist and in case of an invasion, reversed engineered the technology from the Turn-X to create the Turn A. 

Another theory is what Ghingnham says; the Turn-X is the Turn-A's successor, and therefore superior. 

The only definite fact is that the Turn-A and Turn-X fought, the Turn-X lost and somehow got buried on the Moon, where the Turn-A destroyed Earth's civilization an got buried on Earth. And above all, the Turn-A and Turn-X are brothers.

The ""X"" scar on the chest was caused by the Turn-A; despite the nanomachine technoogy to regenerate and repair various damages, the scar is too deep for the nanomachines to repair. 

Its backpack weapons platform can actually fly on its own, and seems to have space for more weapons which were never excavated. Said to also serve as a propulsion system for interstellar travel in some sources. 

Weld-Off/Destruction Manipulator: Known as the Shining Finger, it isn't the same one as seen in the Future Century. The I-field is used to create a beam energy shape and use it for either a beam saber, or fire it like a beam rifle. 

All-range attack system/Bloody Siege: The body of the Turn-X can split into nine parts (head, arms, legs, chest, back, hips, weapon platform), fly around, and attack. If they surround a target, they can charge a magnetic field to disable it.

Behind the Scenes:  
Syd Mead said that the Turn X was something he drew up in half an hour, after seeing the sakura in the garden in an inn in Izu, and considers it the best work for Turn A Gundam that he did. 

It didn't show up for most of the show because the staff found drawing it extremely time-consuming, and as a result plans like having only the head show up until the last two episodes, or covering it up in nanoskin like a mummy until the last episode were tossed around. Mead originally drew it to be white, and Tomino suggested it be Zaku green, and it eventually ended up an extremely pale green. 

Other MS:

Cannon Illefuto: Judging from its height of 15 metres and the cockpit block similar to those of around UC 0120, it can be assumed that it's from the age of the Babylonia war. Made for mid-range combat, as it is only armed with vulcans and a gatling cannon and no melee weapons at all. Has no beam shield which was standard issue for the Babylonia era, but is equipped with a conventional shield with a cross mark that looks similar to the Earth Federation's. 

Bandit: Ginganam serial number: G-M1F. Original serial number: XM-0754. Can be controlled remotely without a pilot, can also operate on its own using a Mobile Warrior System (related to the MD system?). Actually a policing MS made for combating MS crime, and is so equipped with weapons meant for capturing other MS. Weapon rack on the back had knives and scissors. Frame uses nanomachines, and it was apparently sealed away when the use of nanomachines was banned. The beam saber is not the kind that receives energy from the hand, but is activated by a switch. Arms are equipped with wire-claw machines. Capable of atmospheric flight. It should be noted that ""XM"" was used by the Crossbone Vanguard, but that the setting behind the Bandit doesn't seem to fit in with it. 

Flat: FLAT-L06D, originally a ""riot mobile suit"" created for riot control in cities, but were later modified for atmospheric entry. FLAT is an acronym for ""Flexible Ladder Actuator Technology"". Machine uses a unique frame called the Spine System in which everything is based around the spine. The Sonic Blast attack is created from low-frequency audio waves generated by micromachine scales' oscillating particles. By extending super-high vibrations faster than sound to the armour, this creates a ""Sonic Shield"". Can capture textures with cameras on its back and project them onto the surface of the micromachines to camouflage itself like a chameleon. 

Wadom: JMA-0530. Diana Counter mobile suit, but the serial number comes from G Gundam's Neo Japan. The beam cannon is referred to as a mega particle cannon in some materials. The name Wadom comes from ""Walking Doom"". Setting-wise, the Wadom equips technology to disable Minovsky particles (7th-GMPT) 

Wad: MRC-U11D. ""Walking Dumping"". Uses a ""spine frame"". 

Bellona: MRC-C03. Wad variant used for construction work and so on. 

Mobile Rib ""Jet Stream"": MR-SP105ƒ¶. Uses the same spin frame as the Wad. Made for construction work, but tough enough for combat if used right. 

Eagel: TAF-M9. Corin Nander's MS. Once fought over the control of Mars, and is said to have technological connections to the Gundam Virsago. Uses the Wad's spine frame. 

Gozzo: NRS-P701. Serial number indicates that it was made by After War's New Earth Federation, and the cockpit design agrees with that. Made for use as a support unit in space combat, and so it is hard to use on Earth as it can lose balance easily. 

Mahiro: G838. Ginganam's squad's main MS. Said to use the Mobile Trace System. Serial number comes from G = Ginganam, 8 = number of TECH-SPEAK motors, 3 = propulsion system's databus n-count, 8 = TECH-SPEAK freedom level of the TECH-SPEAK motors. Named after its designer, Maeda Mahiro. 

Units not seen in TV/movie versions: 

Moon Butterfly: Seen in the Fukui novelization. Piloted by Diana Soriel and Kiel Heim. A large mobile armour in the form of a butterfly, equipped with psycommu, armed with butterfly-shaped funnels. 

Gekkouchou (yes, in kanji): Seen in the Satou novelization. A machine from Gym Ghingnham's grandfather's collection, hidden in Mistletoe. Pilot is Diana Soriel. Described as a ""big red flower bud"" or ""vagina"" (NOT MAKING THIS UP) which transforms into a ""butterfly shining whitely with the colours of the moon"" emerges. Almost as big as the Soleil (!?), and has an MS in the form of a goddess at its core. 

Black Doll: From the Satou novelization. A big black MS, described to sound like the Psyco Gundam, dug up from the Lost Mountain. (Note: This is where Gwen's ""Black Doll""/Psyco in Alpha Gaiden came from) 

4LEG: Another design by Mead that never showed up. Seems to be a transformable Militia utility mobile suit. Transforms from some that looks like a Flat to a strange mobile armour, and its design was reused in Gundam Seed's Aegis Gundam. Also, full scratch models were made of it by Dengeki Hobby Magazine and Model Graphics. 

Mobile Gaudarda (Gauderda? Gaudada?): From the comic. An MS for training base on the Flat (smaller than the Flat).",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,88786,public,self,,,"SPECIAL COMPLETE INFORMATION on the Turn-A, Turn-X, and other mobile suits from the TURN-A GUNDAM Series",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/j9gcqx/special_complete_information_on_the_turna_turnx/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Knew I was signing up for a convoluted plot this time.

1. I actually liked Kamille this time. Maybe it's because I'm older but his personal growth was interesting and juxtaposed nicely against Amuro.

2. WAY too many mobile suits. Hell to keep track of.

3.Transforming mobile suits were ridiculous. Even in a made up sci fi space opera.

4. Not enough Char/ Huyaki Shiki combat. Second half of the show it was mostly that stupid mega bazooka launcher. Also, Char's dub va sucked.

5. Jared dieing was one of the best things I've ever watched. 

6. Lt. Emma was a solid character throughout the show. Sad to see her go.

7. I don't understand why Reccoa switched sides. Something about being female? What did Char do to her?

8. Did Haman Karn know that Char is actually Casval Rem Deikun? I assumed so but it would seem like neo zeon would want to kill the biggest threat to Mineva Zabi not turn him.

9. Char's speech wasn't as good as I remembered. 

10. Rick Dias was a badass mobile suit. Probably my new favorite mass production model.

11. What happened to Karaba and Amuro? Could have really used them in that final battle.

12. The Kamille-Char mentorship was beautiful to watch.

13. Quebely was pretty cool. Though I think Scirocco was more interesting than Haman. The way he used newtypes makes him the superior villain.

14. Hail Zeon!

15. Thoughts on what I should watch next? I've watched all of UC but it's been years. Watched MSG and War in the Pocket recently. Stardust Memory next or jump to ZZ? Watch the Zeta movie trilogy since it's supposed to have a different ending?

Compare this to the other Gundam motion picture, *Char’s Counterattack*, *F91* was oddly a more satisfying watch – at least in my opinion.

To express the elephant the room, yes the story of *F91* is very compressed, and almost none of the major plot points are remotely resolved by the end. The film was initially going to be a potential 50 episode series, though for whatever reason the show never went into production. Since the first 13 or so episode was already storyboard, *F91* the movie was made from those storyboards and other ideas that the creatives were able to flesh out.

Both this movie and *Char’s Counterattack* suffer from the same issue honestly – they tell incomplete stories. In *CCA*, we pretty much are given the second half of a big long epic. It starts in-media-res, with Char suddenly taking a severe character turn that’s hard to justify. *F91* also sent viewers straight into the action, with the assault on Frontier IV. From there, *F91* would try to compress 13 episodes worth of story into a normal movie runtime. Neither one of the Gundam movies compromised with the type of story they wanted to tell; arguably both movies would have worked better if they both had a more direct beginning, middle, and end story beats. *F91* may have an exciting incident that compels the plot forward as its starting point, but it has no real ending. Sure the main bad guy is defeated, however the Vanguard are still mostly intact. *Char’s Counterattack* has the opposite problem, it has no beginning. *CCA* starts with a battle in Earth’s orbit, and there is no context given to Char’s face turn.

*Gundam F91* is a weirdly paced movie that is both incredibly rush, but also really slow in the middle. The characters are either never given enough time to be fully fleshed out, or are derivative of past characters in the Gundam series. Seabook is one of the least compelling lead characters in the entire franchise; there’s nothing about him that draws you in, and his story is often overshadow by his female counterpart, Cecily. Cecily’s side of the story is by far the most interesting aspect of the movie’s narrative, full of political manipulation, blurring the lines of who are the bad guys, and an eye-patch wearing antagonist attempting to court her. However Cecily suffers from motivation whiplash: after spending most of the film seemingly accepting her family’s ideals, she quickly switches sides after a brief battle with Seabook.

There’s a really weird cut in the film where at the end of a battle, the film literally cuts away to a different location that takes place sometime after the battle. Several major characters also disappear in the middle of the film, and there’s no resolution to any of them.

If the story of the movie is within the C-grade range (at best), than the animation is a solid A+. While there are some inconsistencies throughout the film, it always looks great. The characters’ movement adds a lot of personalities to them, and the colors used in the film are striking. The fight scenes are choreographed well, and the Mecha designs are amazing. The Gundam F91 rightfully gets a lot of love, but I personally really love the Vigna Ghina (is that weird?). *F91* the motion picture may actually be better animated than a lot of the more contemporary Gundam shows, which just shows how well ahead of *F91* was in terms of animation.

There are still some intellectualisms in *Gundam F91* that caught me off guard. *F91* continues the themes of how the younger generation are left with the burdens of the older generation’s mistake, exemplified by how incompetent and detach most of the adult soldiers act towards the mostly young main characters. The movie posits the idea that democracy is just as flawed as authoritarian, and that people in charge of democracy can just be as corrupt as those in a dictatorship.  *Char’s Counterattack* left me kind of cold and unfulfilled in many places as I was expected the same level of complexity that I saw within *Zeta Gundam*. On the other hand, I was expected a more shallow experience with *Gundam F91*, and while it isn’t the most complex film to be put onto screen, it was smarter than I initially thought.

Other highlights include seeing Seabook and Cecily fighting together with their mobile suits in the final battle. We don’t often get badass couples in Gundam because the franchise loves killing off female love interests, so that was a welcome addition. Zabine Chareux is a decent Char-esque character, though disappointed we didn’t get a final fight between him and Seabook or Cecily. Iron Mask kind of sucks as a main bad guy; he’s just a rip-off of Darth Vadar. Speaking of Star Wars, one of the tracks is a total rip-off of the Empire March, right? The opening assault on Frontier IV is probably the best part of the movie, and I wish the full film was just the assault and the main characters just trying to survive.

So in general, I like *Gundam F91*. It has weird pacing, and tells an incomplete story (which I felt that they could’ve fixed if they redid the script a little, but didn’t because of reason). With that said it is a feast for the eyes, and it continues the themes of past Gundam shows that made the franchise a hit in the first place.",True,True,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,88381,public,spoiler,,,Impressions on Mobile Suit Gundam F91 (Spoilers),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/j6d3pg/impressions_on_mobile_suit_gundam_f91_spoilers/,,all_ads,6,discussion,83f4319a-5fa5-11e7-8e79-0ec8348f5b38,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, they were an enjoyable read, and made me appreciate ZZ a bit more. Ok, here are the differences (not in chronological order):

1. Amuro and Beltorchika make an apperance. Amuro talks to Judau about being a newtype, and how being on Earth has made him lose some of his newtype-ness. He says he'll go back to space when Char makes a move (this, and a conversation Bright has with Sayla on the moon are two foreshadowings of CCA).

2. There is no Dublin arc. Instead, they (Judau and Argama crew) go to a former Titans base in Norway after Dakar to meet up with Karaba and get back to space. Argama's attempt to return to space is blocked by Puru Two, and Puru dies here in an attempt to her. Hayato seems more despondent after hearing about Katz' death from Bright, and this fuels his kamikaze attack that finally stops Puru Two from preventing Argama to leave. Amuro directly says that Hayato wanted to be where Katz is.

3. Mashymyre does not become a cyber newtype, and actually forms a three man team with Yazan and Gemon, all three using Gezes. He shares (doesn't take, Glemy is still there) Glemy's role in Dakar and dies there. Yazan tells Gemon he wants to bury Mashymyre properly, and decides he wants to take a rest and settles down in the now peaceful Dakar.

4. Chara Soon practically never interacts with Judau, and I actually can't remember what they do with her before Dakar. She doesn't show up at the final battle, and there is no mention of her (or Gottn's) death. 

5. Glemy thinks he is *Degwin* Zabi's son.

6. There are no clear scenes revealing Kamille recovers from his mental damage. As there is no Dublin arc, all we get is a scene (also in Norway, though he and Fa don't interact with the Argama) talking about the vapor trail that the Argama makes launching into space, but the book still make note of the 虚ろ (hollow/blank/vacant) look still in his eyes.

7. Due to being only two volumes, a lot of arcs were either abridged or cut, such as the Moon-Moon arc. And as you'd think, characters like Iino and Mondo have even less to do, and I swear the latter has like only five lines.

Those are all the big differences I can think of right now, if you have any other questions, please ask!

Zeon are space Nazis that are responsible for the largest amount of war time casualties in human history. Their go to strategy is to murder civilians and most of their leaders have been Hitler clones.

Don't give me that crap about how the federation is just as bad because they oppressed the space noids. Nah. The federation government is corrupt and their treatment of spacenoids was shit but they weren't out here slaughtering them. No matter how justified space noids were in a rebellion, it doesn't change the fact that they became nazis. Zeon is a fascist and deluded side that created villains of the federation when there otherwise wouldn't have been. Operation Stardust created the titans and for what? Oh you dropped another colony congratulations now your people are gonna get gassed and shit because you did to the earth what the earth has done to you.

The titans are evil and they were created by the feds so there's really no sidestepping the earth's own fascist group. But then we got the AEUG and Londo Bell as a result of this dark branch of the federation being snuffed out. Now, let's check back in with Zeon and see if they have righted the wrongs of their past and changed uh nope they're back to dropping more colonies cool cool.

You see what I'm getting at? The feds are shit and have done terrible things but people like Amuro and Bright made changes within the system. But zeon is one note, they only want to destroy earth and then everyone will be magically happy. Mineva and her Sleeves is the closest we've gotten to Zeon actually trying to be diplomatic, even then, the Sleeves are a split faction and not really Zeon.

With all the shit both sides have done weighed against each other its pretty black and white. Zeon are evil and the feds are less evil.

My father used to tell me stories about the coming days, a time of peace when the Newtypes kept balance between the Feddie Colonies, Earth Countries, Zeon Nation, and Neutral Colonies. But that all changed when the Zeon Nation attacked. Only the Gundam's pilot mastered the use of Newtype abilities. Only he could stop this ruthless cycle of hatred they created. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. Nine years have passed and the EFSF is nearing total domination of space.

Two years ago, the Earth and allied colonies joined together to form the tyrannical Titans to help stomp out Neo-Zeon movements, leaving me and my brethren to fight for our colonies. Some people believe that the Gundam was never rebuilt into a new model, and that technology has moved on. But I haven't lost hope. I still believe that somehow, the Gundam will return to end this war.

"" The GM series are truly remarkable fellows. From a single ancestor, they have diversified into many species of Mobile Suits to fill up plenty of ecological niches.""

""Here, we see one species of GM, the Jegan . They have evolved to be pack hunters prowling the depths of space. Like a certain spotted animal distant related to cats, they have a female dominant matriarchal society unlike the Zaku IIs who have a single male ruling over the group. Here, our Jegan clan eyes it's prey; a plodding Big Zam. They quickly give chase. Using their superior agility and pack hunting tactics, they manage to overpower the Big Zam's heavy firepower, bringing down and consuming it even as the Big Zam bleeds out from it's wounds. Opportunistically glancing at the bounty that our Jegan clan brought down, a pack of Zaku IIs approaches the carcass. Though a male Zaku II, told apart by the green females by it's red colouration and it's single horn is more than capable of killing a Jegan, the Zakus decide not to provoke the wrath of the Jegan clan and leaves in search of better prey.""

""GM species come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from the large to the small. Here we see a Heavygun, a nocturnal species of GM sleeping in it's burrow in the Southeast Asian rainforests it calls home. Though small in size, it is a fully equipped hunter. At night, it exits it's burrow to stalk it's prey; Bugs and other species of Bits and Funnels, miniaturised mobile suits and the young of larger mobile suits and mobile armours ""

I was already pretty high on Anime, from **’DRAGON BALL Z’** &amp; **’SAILOR MOON’**, so another Anime, featuring giant fighting robots was irresistible to my pre-teen self.

Missed the first two episodes, but finally caught (the last few moments) of Episode 3 (*’FIVE GUNDAMS CONFIMRED‘*) as it aired. The *first* shot of anything **’GUNDAM’** I ever saw, was Heavyarms kneeing Sandrock in the stomach during their fight. Got into the series, loved it, found out there were many other alternate universe **’GUNDAM’** series as well, and, here we are. Still a huge fan of it.

No need for VPN or anything of the sort now to enjoy playing the only online PC Gundam game anymore!

Choose between Rebellion and Order, two sides which have differing mobile suits to choose from. You can play as only one side, or even play on both with two pilots. This game has mobile suits from almost every single timeline at the moment and has a very large amount to choose from. From the Ball to the Gusion Rebake you're sure to find a mobile suit you enjoy. For new pilots just joining the game your first ten matches will each grant you a DX ticket for a potential suit and after the tenth, Order players will be rewarded with a Unicorn Gundam, and Rebellion players will be rewarded with a Sinanju.

The current [event](https://msgo.bandainamco-ol.jp/gekisz/) running will grant all new (accounts created after September 23rd), and returning (accounts that haven't logged in since before March 25th) players a special ""Gold Haro Ticket"" on October 7th  which can be exchanged for almost any mobile suit available in the game. As well as one DX ticket every day for 10 days. I'd say it's as good a time as any to try it out and see if you like it!

[This](https://sites.google.com/view/msgo-en/home?authuser=0) website can be used as a general lookover and guide for you to look through for some advice and general tips, it also has a complete list of all available mobile suits. Just as a note, the game is only in Japanese and you'll need to rely on other players, google translate or that website in order to translate the menus until you get used to it.

A Human saying.  


*Mobile Suits have always been with humanity ever since they stepped out of the Earth Sphere into a galaxy larger and farther than ever before. As humanity expanded with the invention of the first Earth-made hyperdrives and the exiling of the Principality of Zeon's remnants away into deep space in exchange for independence, they brought their mobile suits along with them everywhere they choose to settle, operating in exotic and sometimes dangerous environments on planets, moons and asteroids. These required adaptations to function at optimal combat performance on different planets, for different methods of warfare and to protect their pilots in such exotic environs . In doing so, they started to diverge from their ancestors on Earth. Let's see how such environments affected the development of Mobile Suits, starting with the Naboo Zeon and the Mirialans, descendants of Zeon.*  


*The Naboo Zeon's home planet is Naboo, a lush planet filled with verdant environments such as plains, forests, rivers and swampy marshlands. These environments are suited for the Zaku series of Mobile Suits due to the Zaku line's excellent track record for forest fighting. In contrast, the near-Human Mirialans' home world of Mirial is a cold and dry planet with the majority of it's land areas either desolate, cold tundras or cold deserts, perfect for the Dom's hover capability. As the remnants of Zeon expanded across the worlds that they settled upon (and as some of the colonists on the colony worlds started to diverge from baseline human genetics) , they further adapted their designs to be more suitable for warfare in their worlds they called home. In the case of the Naboo Zeon, they started to focus on high mobility capabilities in jungle and swamp environments, designing in a unique leg thruster system that enabled hovering for short periods of time , enlarged backpack for improved jumping performance and a improved reactor to power all of this which also enabled it to drive beam weaponry and mount a hyperdrive (together with GM-style large chest intakes to cool off the improved reactor, a first in the Zaku line of mobile suits). This in turn resulted in a more agile machine than it's Zaku II ancestors in both land and space with agility high enough to outmatch the R-type Zakus and in the hands of a skilled pilot, even keep up with a GuAIZ of the One Year War .* 

*For the Mirialans, they decided that their Doms needed to function in the harshest of planetary environments with a particular focus on desert and cold environments. They designed in filters to keep out dust from wrecking the delicate hover systems of the Dom and thermal shunts to channel waste heat back into the mechanisms so that they do not freeze up in cold environments. External fuel tank mounting points together with improved hover systems driven by a better reactor (that also enables it to mount a hyperdrive) were added to cover the long distances between settlements in Mirial. The resulting adaptions of the Zaku and Dom series of mobile suits (the NMS-06 Naboo Zaku and the MS-09M Dwadge) for the planetary conditions of Naboo and Miral served with honour over a long period of service before being replaced with clean sheet designs in both Naboo Zeon and Mirialan service in the era of the New Republic* *(the NMS-15 Gyan and the MS-14A Gelgoog respectively)* *. However, the lessons learnt from adapting mobile suits to the environments of Naboo and Mirial still resonate in the designs of the Gyan of Naboo and the Gelgoog of Mirial.*",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,87896,public,self,,,Naboo/ Mirialan MS development history (Star Wars/Gundam),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/j2m6wc/naboo_mirialan_ms_development_history_star/,,all_ads,6,original,bf8a1020-6da7-11e7-b481-0e1ec61db1f0,Original Content,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gundam Narrative revealed that at the end of UC, the Unicorn Gundam used some kind of time manipulation to revert the engines of the Jegans to a state before they were constructed. This has naturally caused much controversy and confusion over the Unicorn's power, and the perception that it has some sort of time travel abilities.

I(13M at the time) have only been to one Con in my life but it was huge for me. It was the second(out of three lol) year of Big Apple Anime Fest, in 2002.

That con has alot of great memories.

From seeing the western premier(simultaneous with anime con in San Francisco), meeting Shinchiro Watanabe and Yoko Kano, getting a black scimitar, actually buying a copy of sailor moon and the seven dragon balls, getting to spend 2 days there with a different parent each day and seeing them enjoy anime(or at least aeeing them enjoy me enjoying it), getting an advance copy of issue 0 of the western release of Shonen jump, and getting to watch princess mononoke in theaters again....but...


Where gundam comes in is, it was also the western premier of Char's Counter-attack INCLUDING A Q&amp;A with Yoshiyuki Tomino.
I didnt get to ask any questions but it was so cool to meet him anyway.
The last part of my memory sounds a little like r/thathappened material but its small enough I hope you'll believe me.
When the movie started there was a projector issue and it actually started showing the film about 40 minutes in, got garbled then, cut out.
We were all confused but, I stood up and started clapping and hooting and hollering like it whas the best movie ever. The whole theater did it as well.
I can honestly say that was my favorite funny thing I ever did.


Anyway, as I said, whats your memory?
Anybody else go to that con?

Here is my Simple Guide to UC Gundam for the year 2020. 

Basically, this guide gives a quick overview of what I consider the 'main series' that makes up UC Gundam. It is designed to be easy to follow along and give a piece of short information about if a series is worth checking out or notable to mention. Such as if a show is newbie-friendly or if the fanbase really dislikes it etc. I have included both the airdates of series on each section for those who want to watch the series in airing order. I included the UC dates and generally, when shows take place chronologically as that is my preferred viewing order. That and I have included MAL and Kitsu ratings, so that way, fans at a quick glance can see if a show is well received or not. I tried my best to make the most user-friendly and robust guide to get into UC Gundam I can, and this process has been slowly evolving since I started making these charts close to five years ago. 

There is a Side-Content section now that goes over some of the more popular UC series that I would not typically include. Such as animated shorts, manga series that don't really connect into anything, but have large fanbases. Stuff like that. 

I would enjoy people's feedback and hope everyone enjoys it! Be aware that there may be some grammar issues or spelling errors. When you work on a project like this, stuff like that can slip through.

They argue about their actions. Athrun is angry that Cagalli just went out and tried to stop the Orb forces and that she put herself in danger. Cagalli defends her actions saying that Orb shouldn't be fighting and she is doing everything she can to stop Orb from destroying itself once again. Kira takes Cagalli's side and defends her actions. Cagalli pleads to Athrun to help her stop Orb peacefully. Athrun tells her that fighting is now inevitable and peaceful solutions are futile. Athrun is then called back to the Minerva but before he leaves, her notices that Cagalli was still wearing the ring. Athrun asks her if she hates him now or if she will if he continues to fight against Orb. Cagalli answers him with one word: Never. He regains his composure and tells the others to just lay low and stop creating confusion on the battlefield. Cagalli tearfully watches him go.

Shinn and Rey discover an abandoned Extended facility of the EF. Rey reacts negatively and is brought back to the Minerva. Talia and Arthur make a thorough investigation and discover a lot of info about the Extended program.

The Phantom Pain hears about the infiltration, and Auel goes paranoid thinking his mom would die if ZAFT keeps poking around. Sting tries calm him down but Stella heads off to the facility in the Gaia after hearing her block word.

The Saviour and Force Impulse intercept and disable the Gaia. Shinn discovered that Stella is the pilot; he immediately brings her to the medical bay of the Minerva. This obviously confuses everyone. Rey reported the incident to the higher ups, Soon enough, Captain Gladys receives word from the council that they want a living extended brought to them for examination ASAP. So they decide to head out after resupply and repair.

They head out and the largest EF and Orb force ambush them. They fight desperately but the Freedom and Archangel appear once again and attacks everyone on the battlefield. Cagalli also heads out and tries to stop the Orb forces in the area to stop attacking the Minerva and go back to the mainland.

Her words do nothing but anger Shinn, causing him to fire eight missiles at her. The Freedom uses its Picus to shoot down all missiles. It charges at the Blast Impulse but the Saviour intercepts it before the Freedom can get close.

The EF and Orb force resume their attack on the Minerva and the Archangel. Captain Gladys declares the Archangel their enemy. The Murasames charge at the Minerva but Cagalli uses the Strike Rouge to block their path. She learns that the Sarans now rule Orb (and in turn, are puppets of the EF). Baba's Murasame throws the Strike Rouge out of the way and resumes their charge on the Minerva.

Lunamaria and Rey desperately tried to defend their ship but they couldn't stop the barrage of missiles and machinegun fire. Lunamaria's Gunner ZAKU was totaled, injuring her.

Shinn destroys the Abyss and kills Auel. Athrun once again tries to talk Kira into stopping. Kira ignores him, disables the Chaos, and engages the Blast Impulse. Shinn suddenly remembers the Freedom from two years ago and attacks it angrily. Even though he was a match for the Freedom, he was ordered by Athrun to return and help the Minerva because Lunamaria got injured and her ZAKU is out of action.

Shinn switches to the Force silhouette. Baba and his squad go for one last kamikaze charge on the Minerva. The Force Impulse was able to shoot down all Murasames except for Baba's, who successfully rams his Murasame on the Minerva, inflicting heavy damage on its bow (and also damaging Rey's Blaze ZAKU Phantom).

Shinn switches to the Sword silhouette and destroys numerous mobile suits, warships, and carriers from both EF and Orb. Cagalli tries to stop him but is no match for Shinn. A squad of loyal Orb soldiers forced Cagalli to retreat.

The Takemekazuchi charges the Minerva. The Minerva was still able to inflict crippling damage to the carrier. The crew (and Jona) of the Takemekazuchi abandon ship and [those who are still loyal to Cagalli] head to the Archangel as per Colonel Todaka's orders.

Kira and Athrun battle it out because he thinks that Kira is endangering Cagalli by putting her in the front lines (among other things) but Kira tells him that Cagalli is really trying her damn best to stop Orb from participating in the war. The two argue and fight a little bit more but the Freedom ultimately defeats the Saviour. Shinn destroys the Takemekazuchi, killing Colonel Todaka.

Lacus tells Kira that she wants to go to the PLANTs to gather more information about Durandal. Kira objects but Lacus convinces him to let her go. Lacus and Waltfeld disguise themselves and snuck past ZAFT soldiers and checkpoints in an airport. They are found out and the Captain of the military police order his men to shoot down the shuttle Lacus was on.

Several mobile suits shoot the shuttle but before they can hit it, the Freedom enters the scene and disables all the mobile suits in the area. Kira contemplates on whether he needs to go with Lacus. She tells him to stay with the Archangel. Waltfeld promises Kira that he will protect Lacus with his life. Kira asserts that Lacus needs to be careful but before they could say anything else, the communication was cut. Lacus successfully escapes.

Durandal hears about Lacus' stunt and he realizes that she's up to something. He tasks Special Forces to follow her and if need be, eliminate her.

The Minerva goes back to the base at Crete for repairs. Stella's condition worsens and is at the brink of death. This caused Shinn to sneak her out [return her to Neo]. But before he can, Rey catches him. They talk a little and Rey decides to help Shinn. Rey hacks the gates and let's Shinn out in the Impulse. He contacts Neo; they meet and he gives Stella back. With the promise of keeping her away from war and fighting, they part ways.

Shinn returns and is thrown into a holding cell. Rey is also thrown in a cell for his participation. Athrun hears about what Shinn did, but decided not to say anything to the authorities. He talks to Shinn privately and tells him that he will side with him if worse comes to worse.

In Germany the EF deploys their new weapon, the Destroy. The pilot chosen for it was Stella. The Destroy, Chaos, and Neo's Windam wreak havoc in Germany. Shinn is cleared and released because of his achievements recently (and because he was the only ace pilot with a properly working Gundam). After hearing about the events in Germany the Minerva [is ordered to] and the Archangel [decides to] go there.

The Archangel arrives first and the Freedom engages the Destroy (they intercept it in Berlin). Cagalli, in the Strike Rouge, engages the Chaos and the Murusames engage the Windam. The Freedom can't seem to harm the Destroy. When the Minerva arrives, Shinn and Kira team up for a while. The Impulse destroys a portion of the cockpit hatch and sees that the pilot is Stella. He calmly approaches and the Destroy stops attacking. The Saviour Repair launches. Athrun teams up with Cagalli and together they defeat the Chaos. The Freedom shoots down the Windam. Kira tells Murrue to retrieve the fallen pilot.

This causes Stella to panic and start attacking again. Kira then tries to attack the Destroy but instead, Shinn attacked him. Cagalli and Athrun tried to damage or at least distract the Destroy. The Strike Rouge and the Saviour Repair then come up from behind and destroy its main battery pack, causing the Destroy to slowly lose power. The Impulse and Freedom battle it out, and as the Freedom was about to stab the Impulse dangerously close to the cockpit, Stella uses the last bit of the Destroy's backup power to shove the Impulse away and use the huge mobile suit as a shield. The Freedom instead stabs the chest cannons of the Destroy. Stella saves Shinn but she gets caught in a fatal explosion. The Archangel and crew then retreat as ZAFT reinforcements arrive.

Shinn holds a dying Stella in his arms and she kisses him after declaring her love for him and dies shortly after. This causes Shinn to hold a grudge against the Freedom (and its pilot).

Chairman Durandal uses the Berlin incident as a reason to declare the LOGOS as the true enemy of mankind. The Archangel is also labeled as a target and the ZAFT Eurasian force was sent to sink it. Minerva is also ordered to participate in the Operation (Operation Falling Angel). Shinn, in a rage fueled motivation, has studied and analyzed the Freedom's fighting pattern. Athrun refuses to participate in the mission.

Shinn uses the Impulse's block system to gain a significant advantage over the Freedom. Not only does he isolate the Freedom, he also prevents it from helping the Archangel. The ZAFT Eurasian force use overwhelming numbers to slowly but surely surround and pressure the Archangel. The Force Impulse is able to significantly damage the Freedom, forcing Kira to retreat.

As the Archangel approaches the sea, the Minerva fires its positron cannon at the Archangel in hopes of sinking it before it can dive. The Force Impulse impales a retreating Freedom below the cockpit (closer to its waist) allowing Kira to survive. There was no nuclear explosion. The Freedom exploded normally because Kira cut off the power of the Freedom at the last second. Shinn wonders of he did the right thing, and if what he did really avenged Stella.

Back in the Minerva, Shinn goes straight to his room and contemplates. An angry Athrun follows him and talks with him privately. Shinn reveals that he knew he missed the Freedom's cockpit and that the pilot may have survived. He explains that he got brief glimpse of Stella before he impaled the Freedom. Athrun is pleased to hear this but his doubts about ZAFT increases. He tries to emotionally support Shinn in his troubled state.

Kira awakens and talks to Neo (thinking that he is Mu la Flaga) but Neo assures him that he is not the man Kira thinks he is. Murrue suddenly enters and asks Kira if he is alright completely ignoring Neo. But Neo asks about Mu, making Murrue run away, crying.

The Minerva arrives at Gibraltar and Chairman Durandal requests to meet with Shinn and Athrun. He shows them latest machines from ZAFT; the ZGMF-X42S Destiny and the ZGMF-X666S Legend. Athrun is displeased with the offer while Shinn accepts the Destiny. After showing the Destiny and Legend to them, Athrun decides to go back to his room and think.

Chairman Durandal meets with Rey and asks him about what he thinks of Athrun. He tells him that he [Athrun] is a threat to the plan and must be eliminated. Durandal agrees, and plans to charge him with a crime (treason; thanks to Lunamaria's spying) and have Rey take care of the rest. Shinn overhears this and immediately goes to Athrun's room to tell him about it.

Athrun realizes that Durandal has no more need of him and decides to run away. He tries to take Shinn with him but he refused. Saying that there may still be a chance to change his [Durandal] mind. Athrun sternly tells him that that is not possible; that the Chairman is very manipulative and one day, will have no more need of him [Shinn], and eventually kill him. He also asks how he plans to run away and he said he'll think of something.

After a few minutes, the guards knocked on the door demanding Athrun. Athrun then punches Shinn, breaks the window, and apparently escapes. The guards enter and find Shinn on the ground saying that he tried to stop him but got knocked to the ground. As one of the guards look out the window, Athrun knocks him, and the other guards out. Shinn then tells him to stick to the plan and they go their separate ways.

Athrun then ends up in Meyrin's room. Lunamaria and other guards knock at her door, she [Meyrin] covers for him by answering the door, pretending that she just came from the shower. Lunamaria gives her some time to dress up and she closes the door. Athrun asks why she helped him she responds with ""I don't know"". As he was about to leave, Meyrin stops him and decides to help him more. She hacks the computer and sets off an alarm by the Bay (the other side of the base) luring the pursuers there.

They escape using her car, but Rey sees Meyrin and gets suspicious. They arrive at the hangar and decide to board the Saviour Repair. Rey then pops out, starts shooting and declares them both traitors. Athrun tries to convince Rey to let Meyrin go but to no avail. Athrun shoots Rey's gun, causing him to drop it, and the two used the opportunity to board the Saviour Repair.

Rey contacts Shinn about Athrun escaping. Durandal orders them to pursue. Rey informs Durandal about Meyrin's choice to go with Athrun and they get the all clear to shoot them down. Shinn is surprised that Meyrin is with Athrun. They confront each other and Shinn ""tries to talk him into surrendering"" but Athrun flat-out refuses. Rey tells Shinn to kill them because even Meyrin has become an accomplice to Athrun's crimes. Shinn begins to realize the truth to Athrun's words. The Destiny impales the Saviour Repair; purposely missing the cockpit. It [Saviour Repair] falls to the sea and explodes. Rey didn't notice Shinn missing the cockpit and just presumed that they both died.

Favorite shows, favorite character, favorite suits. I wanted to try something a little different this time around. What are your favorite extra equipment accessories from any of the Gundam shows or films? Nothing specifically on the suit itself (so no V-fins, no Wing Zero's or Deathscythe's or Freedom's wings, etc. I'm talking specifically the extra optional equipment the suits can carry or use, what would be the accessories in a model kit or toy. Things like your favorite rifle, rocket launcher, melee weapon, shield, backpacks. If it isn't specifically a part of the Mobile Suit itself, it counts.

For example, I think my favorite shield of any series has to be the collapsible white and blue shield used by the GP-01 in 0083 Stardust Memory. There's just something aesthetically pleasing about the shape of it compared to the likes of other massive shields in the shows, something about the curves that I like. 

I'm also a big fan of the modular backpacks the RX-79 Ground Types use in 08th MS Team (as well as the Ground GMs and the Ez-8 in the show). Being a compact design normally but able to unfold to accommodate the cargo containers and paratrooper units that we see the 08th Team use just helps sell the whole concept of the show being a more realistic take on Gundams. Since the suits in the Kojima Battalion are operating out of a ground base rather than a carrier like we see most other times, it made sense that they'd have to carry their heavier equipment with them in the field just like real soldiers do.

Zeta is good. It has the same sort of tension and release I associate with Lord of the Rings and Dune. A sort of long, slow building doom where things just keep getting keep sort of spiraling down, but its a slow crawl to it. I think that's the nature of it being a year long show. It doesn't lend itself to binge watching.  More than 1 or 2 episodes at a time and the cracks show. It takes a while to get to where its going, and when it gets there, it all happens at once. Some character deaths come far too late and sudden to have the impact they should.  Some have no impact at all.

Some lines are extremely archaic and under developed. I feel like the women/men dichotomy never really hit like its was supposed to. I do like the slow growing realization of what newtypes are supposed to be and Kamille's rejection of Char, Haman and Scirocco all as failures. 

The MS designs I think are hit or miss. Some of the most elegant and wonderful designs are here. The MK II, the Zeta, the Hyaku Shiki, Gaplant and Quebely all have an X factor to them in the way the Gundam and Zaku did. Others like The O, Baun Doc and Hambrabi are just huh?

Still to this day, there's no better anime, Gundam or not, for me. This is my favorite thing. I love everything about it. And everything seems ""original"" and ""best"". I read and watched some of the earlier shows (and some lore learned trough games) and I never understood why ""so many"" fans mostly prefere the UC which to me was never attractive with outdated funny looking suits and animation that didn't age well.

But then you'll come across a generation that will say Gundam Wing is the best thing ever or UC fans that will say CE is an atrocity and so on, but to me everything happening in GS and GSD is absolutely stunning and many scenes bring me to tears even to this day, while I just can't connect with the characters in UC. The AD timeline was pretty cool too, it's my second favorite for sure. I am trying to like the classics like Zeta, Wing and honestly even X seems pretty ok but it's nothing close to my almost fanatical obsession with how much I am in love with every character, every mobile suit and all the bits of story in the CE of GS/D.

I just started watching Unicorn (I'm between ep 3 and 4 now) and I'll say it's a pretty good show, but again, it's not coming close to how cool GS was for the first time and still is now.

Just wanted to share this because I've heared that actually not many Gundam fans like GSD that much and I was simply starting to wonder, maybe it's the first series you watch that really make you think; this is the correct/best timeline and how Gundam should really be, everything else is a bland copy?",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,87386,public,self,,,"Is it normal that the first series-universe you watch, it becomes your all time favorite?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/iz3c2o/is_it_normal_that_the_first_seriesuniverse_you/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They outright state Chars Counterattack makes much more sense if you see Char as a child and Amuro as the adult. Which ties into Brights thoughts in the Unicorn short story, which he states that Char turned his back on being an adult after being thrust into galactic politics in a role he never wanted, a burden too great for him to bear. And with Kamille having his life ruined and his soul scarred, he turned his back on everything. 

And while Banagher inherited Chars hope, Hathaway inherited Chars passion and Amuros ideals. He also had firsthand knowledge of the ideas and ideologies of Amuro Ray and Char Aznable. [Even the producer said the poster composition of Char and Amuro looking back around Hathaway is meant to convey that Hathaway is the true successor and the inheritor of the wills of Char and Amuro.](https://i.gzn.jp/img/2020/03/24/mobile-suit-gundam-hathaway/visual.png)

They also said that Hathaway’s flash was 30 years ahead of its time and that its frighteningly close to reality. With a group trying to change the world mainly by terrorism and assassination, not by major military operations. The environment of Earth is being ruined and endemic corruption is crushing the hope of people.

I had about, oh maybe just four bottles of Mountain Dew earlier and this question just popped into my mind. The Zero System was built like a computer logic system for a Gundam and was able to turn the pilot into a machine bent on achieving the end result based on the data the pilot gave it and current events happening at once. But it is unable to give information on the future.

That got me thinking. The machines that the children in the Gundam Series Iron Blooded Orphans have are able to directly interface with the computer system and they are able to control them to great lengths. I'll just call them AV's for short and because I can barely spell them. Mikazuki is able to use the Barbatos and seems to even think it is sentient at times.

What if the Zero System was able to be recreated if someone was able to find a piece of data that contained the faintest amount of information on that system? Could it happen?

Or it could be lost over time and ages past.

Maybe I need to cut down on the caffine a bit.

And I’m a long-time lurker of the Gundam sub. I’ve seen a lot of support for the show on here as being “good” due to its “lack of handholding.” 

But I don’t see that as the case. Does it hold your hand? Not entirely. But does that make it good? No.

Not having exposition like other Gundam series is, in itself, fine. A lot of great stories drop you in the middle of the “defining event” with no build up just to break it down as you experience it. 

And while Reconguista succeeds in someway on the front in the first episode (kind of), it mostly falls flat. The pacing of the show is accelerated to the point that events that should require build up happen instantaneously, back-to-Back. 

This makes the show hard to follow. It’s not that the story is complex or hard to understand. People on earth stopped scientific development at a certain point to avoid another war like the original UC series, but they start breaking that taboo when people from space/the moon begin to develop a military of their own to come to earth. As per typical Gundam style, politics and in-fighting ensue. 

The overall concept is fine. It’s interesting enough, though mostly a rehash of other Gundams (but that’s not necessarily a fair critique as all Gundams are rehashes of each other). 

But the character decisions, interactions, and the actual execution are all over the place. One moment characters are killing each other, a minute later they’re friends. One moment a character is broken up over something, and not even a minute later, there is some sort of strange comic relief. It makes for an incredibly jarring experience, and it creates a perception of non-sensical behavior and decision-making that makes it hard to suspend your belief in this world. 

There’s not really any tension because there’s no build up. And it’s hard to care about any of the characters when we know virtually nothing about them beyond things that are surface-level, at best. They seem as though they are simply vessels to get the plot moving. 

The entire show feels like characters, events, and decisions would actually be solid if it was twice the length... to give you time to digest things. It’s like watching a 4 hour movie that someone decided to cut into 2. It almost felt like watching the Justice League movie or Batman vs Superman, the theatrical edition, but in Gundam form. 

Regardless of whether it has cool fan-service details, beautiful art, and cool Gundam designs, it’s not a well-executed show.

*Feddie, Zeek. Those words were used by the Principality of Zeon and the Earth Federation to describe their enemies on the opposing side in the One Year War fought millennia ago on Earth. Today, in the era of the New Republic and interstellar travel, those worlds are still used by Humans and their Near-Human brethren to describe and insult those from a particular colony they do not like. Millennia has passed and those planets who are descended from former Earth Federation colonies do not mostly get along with those who are descended from the Principality of Zeon's remnants and vice versa. The descendants of the Principality of Zeon and the Earth Federation scattered across the cosmos with the invention of the hyperdrive . For the descendants of Zeon, they were banished from the Solar System in exchange for whatever planet they settled upon having their independence recognised and for those who claim to be continuations of the Earth Federation government of old, they were descended from Earth Federation planetary colonisation efforts to relive strain upon the damaged ecosystems of Earth and give it time to recover after the One Year War. While cultures have diverged over time from the baseline culture of the Earth Federation or the Principality of Zeon of old due to the vast distances of interstellar colonisation, the successors of Zeon and the Earth Federation of old still maintain some traditions such as their ceremonial military uniforms being obviously derived from either Principality of Zeon or Earth Federation designs depending if they are either descendants of the Principality of Zeon or the descendants of the Federation.*  


Here are the most well known descendants of the Earth Federation: (they are often called Feddies by those who hail from planets colonised by Zeon descendants )  


Corellian Federation: Maintaining the traditions and symbols of the Earth Federation like their Earth Federation ancestors who colonised their home planet of Corellia thousands of years ago, they are known for their hyperspace explorers, mobile suit engineers and smugglers. Aside from the Humans of the Corellian Federation, the native Dralls (sapients descended from burrowing mammals) and Selonians (sapient mustelid like mammals) work hard to preserve the Earth Federation's traditions long lost to time and 'Republicanisation' over the millennia while also looking to the future.  


Hapes Consortium: A matriarchal society based in the Hapes Cluster and descended from a Earth Federation colony in their capital world of Hapes, the Human inhabitants are known for their beauty and inability to see in the dark bundled together with a holier than thou attitude towards men for the females there.  


Zeltrons: Red to pink skinned, they hail from an Earth Federation colonisation fleet that settled on Zeltros and have to adapt their genes to survive in their planet's sun. Building domed cities on Zeltros with an 'always party time' atmosphere and establishing their planet as a pleasure planet , they are known for being hedonists and highly gullible. Despite these flaws, they are highly empathetic and are quite good fighters when pushed.  


Pantorans: Hailing from the frigid desert moon of Pantora in the Outer Territories whom their ancestors in the Earth Federation colonised, they are highly independent, seeking to preserve their traditions of the old Earth Federation just like the Corellians and resilient to cold. They are recognised by their blue skin and their facial tattoos; developed as a way to symbolise lineage.  


Some of the most noticeable Zeon descendants: (Again, called Zeeks by those who hail from planets colonised by the former Earth Federation)  


Axis Zeon: The Zeon descendant faction with the most clout to being considered the true successors to the Principality of Zeon of old, (their rulers are even descended from the Zabis!), they colonised the Earth-like planet of Axis (named after their asteroid fortress of the same name). Axis Zeon is known for it's militaristic nature and a reputation for being aggressive arrogant blowhards amongst the galaxy. They also do not like people who hail from the former Earth Federation planetary colonies such as Pantora, with spitting to physical assault being quite common onto those who hail from the former Earth Federation colonies on their home planet and they do not get along well with the Naboo Zeon, seeing them as 'going native' with the native sapient inhabitants of their home world. Like the Corellian Federation, they maintain the old ways and traditions of the Principality of Zeon.  


Naboo Zeon: Descended from a Neo Zeon movement that settled on the verdant world of Naboo, they are known for their arts and being peaceful in nature. They initially fought the Gungan natives before deciding to live together in peaceful coexistence initially separate from one another before deciding to deepen relations after the Trade Federation invasion of Naboo. While pacifists in nature, like the Zeltrons, they make surprisingly good warriors and tacticians whenever their way of life is threatened. They do not like their Axis Zeon brethren, seeing them as warmongering brutish throwbacks to a less civilised time on Earth millennia ago. They retain some traits of their Zeon ancestors such as their uniforms and mobile suit designs but adapted for their worldview.  


Mirialans: A spiritual Near-Human people descended from a Zeon Remnant colony fleet that settled onto the cold and dry world of Mirial, they are known for their agility, flexibility and their deep religious beliefs, derived from the Contolism of Zeon Zum Deikun. They have skin tones ranging from green to yellow and geometric tattoos, used to indicate skill. They are mostly peaceful in nature just like the Naboo Zeon but they are quite competent fighters when the situation calls for it. They are quite spiritual but they retain some traits of their Zeon ancestors.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,86601,public,self,,,Descendants of the Federation and the Principality of Zeon (Star Wars/Gundam cross),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/itxaeh/descendants_of_the_federation_and_the/,,all_ads,6,original,bf8a1020-6da7-11e7-b481-0e1ec61db1f0,Original Content,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Right away, there were early signs of the season’s overall narrative hiccups. The show decided to pull a *Beerfest*, and replaced one of the dead main characters with his identical-looking brother. Not only that, several characters that seemed to have clearly perished last season were now alive again, with very little explanation given to their survival.

Season 2 also took a lot of story short-cuts to get the plot to where it needs to go, not allowing the characters have any real agency to the narrative. Setsuna is designated as the main protagonist of *00*, yet nothing about him specifically makes it seem like *00* is his story though. He’s just one of the members of Celestial Being who so happens to pilot the most powerful Gundam, yet somehow he essentially becomes Jesus at the end simply because the narrative artificially designated him as the lead of the show. Like I don’t understand why he should be the one that saves humanity over someone like Lockon or Tieria, other than the fact he pilots the titular 00, and there isn’t any real good reason how he could pilot the 00 Gundam other than the fact that he worships Gundam, which is dumb.

There was a lot of bad story beats this season, particularly when it came to character motivations. A lot of side characters’ motivations were either inconsistent, nonexistent, or just straight up stupid. Nena is a dumb secondary villain, whose motivation kept whiplashing throughout the seasons. Ali al-Saachez is a one-note, over-the-top villain with no real motivation at all. Graham Aker’s role this season is utterly pointless; you can literally cut him out of the season and not miss anything, which is a shame because I really liked Graham in the first season. Marina continues to be uninteresting, and her storyline goes nowhere (maybe it is symbolic or something, I don’t know).

The final climax is a clutter mess, with a lot of plot solutions being resolved by Setsuna’s Newtype, I mean Innovator, powers. A lot of vital character moments within the secondary cast were skimmed over in order to get them to that point of the climax. Billy Katagiri, who seemed like a chilled dude in S1, was suddenly working with Innovators in the last few episodes because he felt betrayed by Sumeragi, which was kind of a big leap for the character. Kati Mannequin switches sides’ in-between-episodes, and somehow gets together a small army to help Celestial Being; while the plotting of the story was clearly foreshadowing Mannequin’s turncoat, we the audience didn’t really get to see the character make that decision on screen. Also, Patrick Colasour seemingly explodes again in the final battle, though shows-up in the epilogue to marry his Colonel (was he also saved by Setsuna’s BS Innovator powers?).

There are also little things throughout the season that particularly irked me. There were a lot of plot convenient that I didn’t like (how did A-Laws get a second Memento Mori?), some plot holes that bothered me more than usual (why did the A-Laws send Sergei Smirnov to meet with Katharon when they were just going to kill everyone anyways?), and useless annoying characters (Andrei… that is all). 

Not only that, I also got kind of a very “old school” vibe from 00 when it came to portraying its female characters this season. Gundam has always had problems with portraying women, nevertheless in 00, there are a lot of men characters talking about how the only two recurring women pilot in the entire show (Louise and Soma/Marie) shouldn’t be fighting. I understand the intent with Allelujah’s and Soma’s subplot; Soma/Marie was a lab experiment and forced to become a super soldier, so Allelujah didn’t want her to be a soldier anymore. However it just came across as being condescending to women. Allelujah was also a test subject, yet chooses to continue to fight, a decision that the show is against with Soma for no other reason than that she’s a woman. Louise was being manipulative, which gives it more leeway, yet it is still questionable to have the two main female pilots not join the army through their own will or agency. In fairness to *00* though, it did have several woman characters in lead positions in the army, which is certainly better than a lot of other early Gundam.

If it seems like I hated the second season, I didn’t really. I was never bored watching it, and the show has overall good pacing (except for its final leg of episodes) and action. Another decent thing I could say about the season is that the main villain is step-up from the previous season. I expected Ribbons to be another boring antagonist like Alejandro, and while he isn’t terribly original, he has ten times more of a personality than Alejandro ever did. He may come off as another emotionless villain, he is at least very full of himself, and speaks down to everyone. He actually interacts with the other main characters, and he does add personal stakes with Tieria and Setsuna. By being perfectly serviceable, Ribbons is leagues better as the main villain than Alejandro ever was. 

There are also some story elements that I actually really do love this season, with the highlight for me being the Saji and Louise plotline. In the first season, the couple’s storyline felt very detached from the rest of the season, and almost conflicts with the show’s tone. Their storyline was more of a light-hearted rom-com, but then took a big turn by the end of the season. What happens to Louis at the end of the first season is actually really contrived (Nena killed everyone at the wedding because they were happy? Uhhh…). In spite of that, it does lead into one of my more favorite narrative clichés in fiction; a female and male love interest on the opposing sides of a conflict, and one of them has to save the other from going too far down the dark path. Apparently the writers of *00* also love this trope too, as they would do this particular storyline two other times in the second season (Allelujah and Soma/Marie, and Lockon 2.0 and Renew).

The Saji and Louise arc can come across as being more soap opera-y, but it is honestly the kind of soap I don’t mind washing my mouth with. Louise becoming a pilot was definitely a direction I did not expect, and her more serious demeanor is a complete contradiction to how she was in the first season. I like how detach she became, and that she now comes off as a damaged person. Saji is an annoying character – he whines for the first half of the season, and is hard to sympathize with his pacifist stance. Yet in spite of that, the first season did the important leg work of making me care about Saji and Louise being together, which made their separation genuinely heartbreaking. Seeing them on opposing sides adds drama to the story, and thanks to that first season, and adds an emotional investment in the story that wasn’t really there in the first season. I also liked the scene where Louise kills Nena (yeah I guess?), and starts going mad by talking to her decease parents. That particular scene has shades of Kamille’s mental breakdown at the end of *Zeta*, and I hope that was an intentional homage.

Setsuna comes across as being too one-note for me to love him as a “protagonist”, but one other aspect of the season I like is how Setsuna does start showing empathy. His growing investment with Saji trying to save Louise was decent character development, and I do love how the two of them do grow closer as friends. I liked when Setsuna actually talk to Louise at the party early in the season, and how he does seem to take responsibility to what happened to her and Saji. Setsuna has grown to care so much about Saji’s needs that he willing helps him find Louise in the middle of a battle, just so that they can help convince her to leave the A-Laws.

I don’t know, am I insane to care so much of this particular plotline? I’m curious what other people’s opinion on this arc is. If there is something I really don’t like about Saji and Louise (other than the fact that Saji sucks), is its resolution. Again, this goes with Setsuna’s supernatural Newtype/Innovator/The Force/Space Magic powers, which just straight up resolved everyone’s internal character arc. Not only that, with all the build-up with Louise and her giant mobile suit, it was really disappointed that her final fight with Setsuna and Saji wasn’t given a bigger focus. In general, Setsuna didn’t seem to have much issue taking it down.

In large, the second season of *00* is a mix bag. Weak character motivations, inconsistent storytelling, and a messy final arc puts this season down. However it is made up by some of its more melodramatic moments, good fight scenes, and several memorable characters worth investing in. I wouldn’t place *Gundam 00* as one of my favorites in the franchise (that privilege goes to *G*, *War in the Pocket*, and the admittedly just as messy *Zeta*), nonetheless I would highly recommend for people to at least watch the series once.",True,True,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,86514,public,spoiler,,,Impressions/Mild Rant on Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Season Two (Spoilers),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/ite137/impressionsmild_rant_on_mobile_suit_gundam_00/,,all_ads,6,discussion,83f4319a-5fa5-11e7-8e79-0ec8348f5b38,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I mean naturally I’d assume they readjust them for each drive but, can they adjust on the fly? But if it’s the former does that mean that ribbons got lucky and got the 0-Gundams original drive, and potentially create a minor plot hole since he wouldn’t know which one he got?

I'll start:


&amp;nbsp;



1) Shinn Asuka was one of the best protagonists Gundam ever had...until the show went out of its way to sabatoge him.

&amp;nbsp;

2) The Build series is a good thing for Gundam.   Gundam persists because it constantly reinvents itself to suit the times, and this, like G Gundam *(made when shounen hero anime like DBZ and YuYu Hakusho were at their peaks)* is a way to keep Gundam relevant during a time of waning mecha genre popularity. VRMMO anime are apparently the bee's knees now, so Gundam follows suit.

&amp;nbsp;

3) I like Shining Gundam more than God Gundam.

&amp;nbsp;

4) Speaking of God Gundam, I think Burning Gundam and Dark Gundam from the translation are actually better names thematically, as they kind of half-assed the God/Devil dichotomy anyway.

&amp;nbsp;

5) Gundam AGE is a good series hampered most by its visual design.  If you can get past that, there's actually a lot to like there.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm hoping someone can help me find a childhood toy of mine so I can see about getting it again. I'll describe it best I can.

I live in the US.

It was a toy from Mobile Suit Gundam.

I'm 90% sure it was the original Gundam.

It wasn't a model as it came fully assembled.

I think it came with the Gundam rifle, the shield, and at least one beam saber.

It was big. Not huge, but much bigger than the regular sized action figures.

I recall it also came with a separate jet fighter, or core fighter as the anime calls it. I cannot remember if it had other accessories but it could have.

I'm pretty sure the arms and legs moved with those clicking joints a lot of big all plastic toys tended to have.

It came apart very easily. You could separate the torso from the legs and I think the middle section could transform into another jet fighter.

I am pretty sure it was all plastic but I'm not entirely sure.

I recall it having a lot of extra minor features like flaps on the shoulders that could open/clos.

I forget the year I got it but if I had to guess I'd say 2000 to 2002.

And I'm pretty sure it was officially released in the states so my folks didn't import it. Plus it was a brand new modem (at the time) toy for an old anime.

I'll provide any other information I can if asked.

Everyone says the Unicorn could maybe even travel time, like Full Frontal and Banagher did, but no one discusses the possibility that they initiated a new universe at the end of their current one?

They called the resonance a miracle which happened before in Axis Shock. It's neat though because I watched the anime Heroic Age before and it had a scene like that where it turned out that they were the ones who started the Big Bang of their universe from the beginning (although it was a result they didnt linger on, it was kind of a oh cool moment for the audience). It was shown without explaining it, but was depicted excellently so that people who enjoyed scifi could deduce what they were seeing.

However the scene where Full frontal and Banagher went to the end of the universe wasn't. It was some trippy visuals but based on what Full frontal was preaching at the time, along with what Lalah's spirit told him in response and also what Banagher witnessed afterwards...could it be said Lalah did more than retort his philosophy, but actually showed him he was wrong by using the warm light he's been rejecting to start the cycle of life all over again at the end of theirs? 

Trippy shit yo. Say what you want about Turn A and its endgame level tech and power levels...but damn, newtypes and psycho-frames are universe bending, soul touching awesomeness.

 This is why Unicorn went from my least fav gundam design to my most favorite. It's the pinnacle of feel good tech evolution and newtype possibilities, right before late UC starts with their nonsense and new tech path.

It's also why 00 feels good. It kind of shows where the gundam tech can take humanity to new heights instead of getting brushed away out of fear like late UC does

First of all, title. Is it any good? The gameplay seems a little clunky from the trailer, and it’s got a dating sim-like interaction thing for characters, so I’m on the fence. 

If it’s good, I’ll give it a shot—but here’s the part two: why aren’t there any real Gundam RPG type games out there? Why hasn’t Bandai Namco released something like Steel Battalion for Gundam in the west? Closest we could’ve gotten was Operation: Troy, but we all know that won’t be coming here, unless they do a remaster and release it to the West. 

So what’s stopping them? Is it still the age-old argument they’ve been pushing that Gundam just isn’t as popular in the West so they won’t try making quality games? 

I’m not gonna dog on games like Versus, Battle Operation 2, and Extreme VS MaxiBoost On, because they have their own niches. 

I’d say something like BO2 but first-person and make it an RPG—why can’t that be a thing? It seems to be set in the UC timeline, given how Zeon and EFSF mobile suits exist... so what gives? 

Is it that they think it won’t sell?

Or is it that I’m the only fan (or part of a seriously small minority) that wants this kind of thing? I’m not even asking for something like Heavy Rain with tons of endings, just a good RPG set in the Gundam universe where I can have my outlet for wanting to be a mobile suit pilot and actually have a story surrounding that. 

Maybe I have to set up a Mekton campaign around that or something? I dunno. 

But I’ve rambled on enough—what do you guys think?

Hear me out:

In ""The Expanse,"" when anyone born off-planet and living in space visits Earth or a planet with Earth-like gravity, their bodies suffer from the effects as they aren't used to it.

We know that astronauts who have lived in space on the ISS go through an intensive physical therapy before they're able to live normal lives again.

With those 2 examples and others that I'm sure exist, I feel like the Zeon soldiers on Earth would suffer from similar effects. Immune system suffering, their internal balance thrown off, and not being in their artificial or reduced gravity environments would severely mess with their internal equilibrium.

Their invasion would be hampered by Zeon soldiers in a constant state of dizziness and everyone getting sick or feeling like hell from their breathing of true Earth atmosphere as opposed to the ultra purified air of asteroid manufacturing facilities and the space colonies.

Yes, they may be piloting various vehicles, but it would almost be more akin to a bunch of wasted people piloting Zakus slamming into each other and their wheeled vehicles getting stepped on due to the pilots not being able to see straight. Are MS units equipped with barf bags in the cockpits?

Ideally, I'd be able to turn the music off and just stand, move, and listen.

I'm debating importing a used copy of Operation Troy since I have a JP Xbox 360, but I'm not sure if Sense 0079 would be a better pick. Or maybe the Dreamcast Blue Destiny game, if that has cockpit view.

I'm already aware of the 360 YouTube video and the anaheim journals, but any suggestions on cockpit Gundam games would be welcome. Non-Gundam could also be useful, but I'm really going for the mobile suit feel.

Selfish, spoiled, careless, self-centered; basically everything that makes someone immediately unlikable, Reiji most likely exemplifies it. 

He is unnaturally gifted at seemingly everything and is quite disrespectful towards everyone. His devil may care attitude also has implications that he doesn't value anyone else besides those who can give him immediate self gain. I have yet to seem a moment where he acts selflessly and I have high doubts that he will. I understand that he is supposed to foil Iori, but if Iori is supposed to be completely likable (he's not), I don't think the solution was to make Reiji totally unlikable. 

Examples of how classless and selfish he has been so far: trespassing onto school property and trying   
 to instigating an assault n student for asking him to leave, taking advantage of Ral's kindness and insulting his love of his hobby at every opportunity, forcing the Italian Gunpla champ and celebrity to face him 200 times until their fingers were raw and presumably bloody, trying to steal food from a girl his age who legally bought food and refusing to reimburse her after throwing it into the ocean; the list goes on and probably will continue to go on.

Today,I'll be covering the Night Elves from Warcraft.

Here are the main factors that would affect the mobile suit designs of the Night Elves:

Small population/low birth rate: Due to their long lifespans, the Night Elves would see no reason to have children that often and only do it every few centuries or so, they would have a low birth rate and a small population as a result. This means that their numbers would be limited by their small population and less focus would be put into specialised mobile suits and more onto generalist mobile suits that are able to fulfil a variety of roles.

Dispersed population bases: Night Elves tend to be either nomadic or live in villages far away from each other with a few NEs living in cities such as Darnassus (which got destroyed, unfortunately) . This would mean that their population is quite thinly spread and manufacturing needs to be conducted in modular blocs in cottage industries such as the production of Mobile Suits.

Nature-respecting ways: This would rule out a nuclear reactor as a power source as I do not think  that they would take too kindly to nuclear reactor kabooms happening inside their forests that they treasure. As such,a battery powered design would be needed.

&amp;#x200B;

With this in mind, I have the perfect mobile suit suitable for the Night Elves, the ZGMF-1000/ZGMF-1001 ZAKU Warrior/ZAKU Phantom.

Why, you might ask? The ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity series is an example of a multi role design that would be suitable for the Night Elves. Alone, it is a jack of all trades MS. But, slap on the Wizard Packs and that's where the fun begins. Need an artillery or a sniper MS? The Gunner Wizard has you covered. You need your squadron to do a mission that requires high mobility? Well, look no further than the Blaze Wizard.  Like melee combat? Well, we got the Slash Wizard for you. With the versatility of the Wizard Packs and it's generalist design, it is suitable for the Night Elves' small population. Best of all, the Wizard Packs would help to simplify production and designs for the Night Elves'  dispersed population as rather than having to design a new mobile suit for a specific role, they can design a Wizard Pack for that role and save on costs.

Oh, and that thing runs on a battery, so that they do not have to worry about the fallout from nuclear explosions damaging their forests.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,85929,public,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-Ekx6UI6acXUX8aduCQ8Qau5hMOR4HCFwpyvcyYMA6A.jpg,140.0,140.0,What mobile suit design would Night Elves use?

I think that this is a  wasted chance to 'flip' the designs such that the monoeye designs are mostly used by the good guys and the bad guys are using GM style designs. 

One out of universe reason would be as odd as it may seem, a mono-eye adds some sort of expression to a mobile suit. We tend to use eyes  to see a person's thoughts and emotions. Similarly, a mono-eye would give some cues to what the pilot is thinking when it is swivelled and looking at something. Now look at a GM-style head. There is nothing to emote here or give clues to what the pilot is thinking as all elements of a face such as the eyes/sensors are covered up by a visor and hence there is nothing for the audience members to consider what the pilot is thinking unless it is directly looking at something.

This in turn would also mean that the lack of expressiveness offered by a GM-style head would be perfect for the Titans' cold brand of brutality. While Zeon Remmants and Neo Zeon movements are screaming fanatics who would kill you in the name of 'spacenoid independence' , the Titans would kill you and not even flinch while doing it. To them, if you are a spacenoid or someone who opposes them, they would kill you without a single thought otherwise and hence a GM-style design  would be perfect for showing the soullessness of the Titans via the lack of emotion that a GM-style design offers in covering up optics with a visor.

The main-in universe reason would be that the Titans are Earthnoid supremacists, they would object in a very violent manner if they have the aesthetics of any Spacenoid designs which they consider inferior.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,85918,public,self,,,Why the Titans should use GM-style designs rather than monoeyes.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/ips4fu/why_the_titans_should_use_gmstyle_designs_rather/,,all_ads,6,discussion,83f4319a-5fa5-11e7-8e79-0ec8348f5b38,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standing right there at the centre of the mass destruction was a Mobile Suit that had once fought for the freedom of others, reborn in the vision of a mass murderer. Its new form form simply did nothing more than kill and destroy everything in its way as it glared down on the remaining pile of scraps with its menacing golden eyes. The Mobile Suit, ZGMF-X20A Strike Freedom Gundam. 

""H-He killed them...!"" Thought Shinn. ""He really did kill them!"" 

Shinn did not expect that he would do such a thing. Was everything that knew about that person before was just a simple illusion? A mere lie? Was he really nothing more than a murderer that took away his family's life? 

Whatever the case may be, he simply just can't stand around doing nothing. There's only way one to get his answer. He tightened his grip onto the controls and took a deep breath.

The Destiny's Wings of Light shone brightly throughout the battlefield as the firmly-resolved Shinn flew towards one of the people responsible for this final battle; Kira Yamato.

Shinn equipped the beam rifle and shot a single yet powerful beam at the Strike Freedom

As if reacting at the speed of light, the Strike Freedom activated its left hand beam shield and blocked the attack. 

The Destiny came to a full stop. Shinn shouted at him, ""Kira Yamato!""

""Oh,"" the voice that responded back was completely devoid of any life, a voice that's as cold a corpse could be. However, it undoubtedly belonged to the person that could have piloted that machine, Kira Yamato, ""Shinn, huh? You joined Orb, huh?""

""That's right! What about you?! Why the hell did you join Chairman Durandal?! Explain yourself!""

""Explain? Very well. I'm doing this to save everyone.""

""'Save'?""

""That's right. And I'm using the Messiah to achieve that goal.""

""Huh?! You're not making any sense!""

He merely smirked at the reply, ""Then, I'll explain it to you."" The two distanced themselves from each other. ""I-""

A sudden shout suddenly stopped Kira. ""Kira Yamato!""

The two turned to see a Mobile Suit from Orb, the MVF-M11C Murasame. The same voice spoke again from within the Mobile Suit, ""Kira Yamato! I have come here to talk to you!"" 

""Talk to me?"" Asked Kira. 

""Yes!"" The man answered. ""I came here to thank you."" 

""It's that guy...!"" Thought Shinn. 

""You came here to thank me?"" Asked Kira. 

""That's right! Two years ago, I was a ZAFT soldier. During the battle of Jachin Due, if you hadn't spare me, I would've never been able to live peacefully with my family in Orb. So... I wanted to thank you, personally."" 

""I see."" 

""That's why, I'm here to also ask you to stop all this."" 

""'Stop'?"" 

""The soldiers that you fought... They're all grateful for you for not taking their lives away, for letting us feel peace, even if it was only brief. Which is why, I'm asking you to stop all this. To be killing everyone left and right, it isn't like you! So please... Stop this!""

""So, because of me, you were able to live in peace these past two years, huh?"" 

""That's right."" 

""Then... How about I make that you feel that peace for eternity?"" 

""What do yo-

Without a second to spare, a hole formed into the Murasame's cockpit by a beam shot. The Mobile Suit exploded into mere scraps and debris seconds after. 

Shinn's eyes widened in shock, only for his entire body to explode with pure anger. He immediately equipped the Arondight Beam Sword, allowing it to fold out and emit a beam blade. He dashed towards Kira and swung at the cockpit. 

Kira of course was able to react in time and blocked the attack with the barrel of his beam rifle. 

Shinn shouted at him with anger, ""Why the hell did you do that?!""

""He'll die sooner or later. I merely fastened the process.""

""What kind of reason is that?! You heard him yourself! He's got a family! And you... You killed him!"" 

""His family will die sooner or later, anyway."" 

""What was that?!"" 

""Listen, Shinn. I had tried my hardest to not kill anyone in order to prevent any more killings. But in the end, it doesn't even matter whether I choose to kill or not. There will still be people who die because of my actions. So, I decided to kill everyone.""

Shinn became more and more confused by his words each second passing. ""Why?!"" 

""Think about it. As long as you're alive, you'll only feel pain. You'll only suffer. If you die, you can never feel that pain anymore. You'll achieve true peace. As long as people are free, they will also inflict pain onto others. If I kill everyone, if I strike down everyone's freedom, no one can hurt anyone anymore and no one will be able to feel pain any longer. It's the perfect plan!"" Kira Yamato let out a maniacal laugh that would send a shiver down anyone's spine. 

Shinn finally realised that he had truly become nothing more than husk of his former self. 

""You're goddamn crazy!""

""If being crazy is what it takes for me to save everyone, I'll gladly do it! I'll become the true saviour that will bring salvation to everyone!""

""Tch!"" The Destiny quickly stepped onto the Strike Freedom's chest and used it as a launching pad to distance themselves.

Just wanted to ask my fellow Gundam-fans, if they commissioned another **’BATTLE ASSAULT’** GUNDAM fighting game, what would be your “Dream Roster” of suits, AND, going further, what would their ‘Special Moves/Attacks” be?

If you had full creative-reign of the next **’BATTLE ASSAULT’**, wherein which you could choose your own roster of Gundams &amp; suits from throughout ALL the current series, (with a 60-Character limit), which ones would you pick to go head-to-head against each other?

This has been driving me crazy but I remembered a very old anime from early childhood that I would wake up and watch at 6am but i've never known the name. My parents were temporarily working in the middle east at the time and it appeared to be an older anime ('70 - 90's animation style, I was watching it probably in '95 - '96)

1.) it was a gundam/mecha where the gundam was hidden in a waterfall and whenever it left it was in the shape of a raft and it would obviously transform afterwards. I distinctly remember it having a gundam like head and the rest of the body was circular like a raft.

2.) not 100% sure on this one but I believe the main character looked like he was an adult guy, skinny but tough looking and had long brown hair.

I've watched 

0079

Zeta

ZZ

CCA

War In The Pocket 

Stardust Memory 

08th MS Team 

Unicorn

and I feel like Unicorn is a really good cap to the universe (even though there's Narrative as a sequel and Hathaway is coming out later) This whole show felt like a love letter to UC and there's so much to gush about it from the music, characters, and finale. 

I think Banagher is fine as a character, he reminded me a lot of Kamille in how empathetic he is. The scene where he's clutching his chest after Marida dies was heartbreaking. The only issue I have is that I didn't really understand why he wanted to help Audrey a few minutes after meeting her. To declare that he wants her to say she needs him was a little strange but other than that he's a fine protag, just not one of my favorites like Shiro or Kamille. At least he wasn't as bad as Kou....

Mineva was fucking great. In Zeta and ZZ, she felt more like a McGuffin than anything and the whole imposter thing at the end of ZZ was really confusing, so to have such a headstrong and assertive personality was really cool, and I'm guessing Kudelia from IBO was inspired a little bit off of her?

Full Frontal was fine, I wish we got a little bit more of his backstory, maybe during the scene when he and Banagher are having tea or even because I think it would've been interesting to see that be developed. 

Marida was such a great character. The scene where Banagher was about to hit her cockpit and they resonated as Newtypes as we saw Marida's backstory (and Glemy!!) gave me so many goosebumps. Its such a shame she died, I wish just one of the Ple clones lived happily (besides the one form Gundam Evolve) 

The score for this show was fucking phenomenal. There were so many scenes that were absolutely amazing, like the Unicorn getting out of the cage, FF's first appearance, the ""fight"" between Loni and Banagher, the fight with Unicorn, Banshee, Delta Plus, and the end scene where the Unicorn and Banshee Norn block the Colony Laser. 

There's a lot more I can talk about with Unicorn, but you guys already know whats good about it.

 I think the few gripes I do have is that some of the plot points from the Novel like why the terrorist explosion happened should've been included and I feel like the Vist Foundation as a whole could've just been Anaheim Electronics, just because that's a name everyone is more familiar with and it would've tied things up nicely instead of introducing this brand new organization from nowhere (I know Vist is the parent of Anaheim,  but I still think the show could've said Anaheim a whole instead of introducing Vist and it would've been a little more fitting just because AE has been making mobile suits for both Zeon and EFF) 

I'll be honest, I didn't really like 0079 and ZZ that much, Zeta was good for its bittersweet ending and Kamille, so I think the OVAs is where UC really shines, and that's really only in two of them, that being 0080 and 08TH MS Team. But Unicorn made this whole experience amazing.

That all was until about a month ago, when I met a new group of (online) friends who all pretty much have watched a good chunk of Gundam and actually talked about it a lot. That's when I asked ""Where do I start? There are so many series and many of them following a set chronological order, it all seems confusing"", and so they just told me to start from the actual beginning. Mobile Suit Gundam from 1979.

Not the recap movie trilogy, mind you. The actual show. Since we're amidst a pandemic and was in the middle of summer break, I actually sat down and watch every one of the show's 43 episodes. And... I loved it. I absolutely loved every single bit of it.

The characters were all super charming and memorable, something I didn't expect from the oldest animated show I've ever watched thus far (the only one that comes close is the original Dragon Ball). The music, even if it replayed the same handful of funky tracks over and over, was incredibly catchy and I grew to love it. The overarching story I feel was pretty good, even if I felt like the epsidoes between 3 and 8 all almost got me to drop the show. But once Garma met his end, and things actually got started... It all clicked. I was hooked and I binged the last 10 episodes in a single evening/night.

Once the final scene of the final episode hit, I was on the verge of actually shedding a few tears, seeing these characters I got to know and love reach the end of this journey.

... And then I went straight to watching the Origin OVAs. And words cannot possibly describe how hard my mind was blown. Not even with the stellar animatin that is an indescribable upgrade from 0079, but also for the mount of context it gave to many characters I thoght would be one-note (most notably Ramba Ral and Hamon, as well as the obvious: Casval and Artesia).

I finished the last episode of The Origin with so much hype to continue, that I couldn't possibly imagine getting even more hyped.

And then I saw the Opening of Zeta.

I haven't watched Ep1, but after all of this, curiosity got the best of me and I looked it up on YouTube. N words will ever describe the chills I felt near the end, when the cast of 0079 all grown up started popping up one by one. Even the 3 kids are staying for the ride!

Well, sorry if this got kind of long, but I'm incredibly grateful to those friends for introducing me to this amazing franchise. I loved every bit of 0079's cheesyness and The Origin got quite a lot of goosebumps from me.

It's not like they're going to drift in space forever. After the battle is over, they can just be simply picked up.

Now, I did talk to another Redditor and he specified to me the problems he had with this.

&gt;It's not as simple as waiting to be picked up. Remember, they're still in the middle of a battle. A stray weapons fire can take them out of their misery, the failing reactors/batteries/equipment of their broken MS can blow up in their faces, their normal suits may be breached and they're at the mercy of hypothermia and rapidly depleting oxygen levels. It's whataboutism, yes, but they're realistic scenarios in combat. It's like disabling a tank or a ship in the middle of a heated battle and it's only a matter of time before a wayward round, leaking fuel/munitions getting ignited or an enemy sweep team comes before the friendly search and rescue team and takes out the poor crew.

And yeah, I get where he is coming from but then the question comes, why do you care so much if they did die in those ways, then?

Let me explain. The guy said that these are all just ""what if"" scenarios but they said that they could still have a *chance* of happening.

I agree, it's only a *chance*. That wouldn't necessarily mean that it *would* happen.

Getting shot by a stray weapon wouldn't necessarily happen. It's merely a chance. A chance that's less than likely could happen. And if it doesn't happen, a lot more people would actually come out of the battle *alive*. 

Even if it did happen and one person died, that wouldn't mean all of them would be shot by a stray weapon. If other enemies shoot the MS's cockpit and the pilot dies, isn't that exactly what you wanted in the first place? Even then, it's still less than likely would happen because other people are too focused on trying to keep their lives and has no time to focus on a pile of scrap floating through space. 

OK, but then what about the other ways they could die like

&gt;the failing reactors/batteries/equipment of their broken MS can blow up in their faces, their normal suits may be breached and they're at the mercy of hypothermia and rapidly depleting oxygen levels.

But, how exactly can those things happen? Kira only targets two things; the Mobile Suits' limbs and the main camera unit (aka the head of the MS) so how can those other things mentioned can happen exactly? Don't give me that crap that he would *accidentally* hit those things when he's 1. A very skilled pilot (Being the Ultimate Coordinator and all) and 2. Has the Freedom's multi lock-on system.

It's simply not possible unless Kira is super careless about it which we already knows he isn't.

Okay, the Redditor followed it up with another point. 

&gt;That along with the mindset of ""I didn't aim at their cockpits though"" or ""I wasn't intending to kill them anyway"" is just a cheap way of having a clean conscience, especially for characters whose developments involving them having to man up for their actions.

Now, wait a minute. Why would you think that Kira wouldn't take responsibility for his actions if those people did die as a result of him disabling the Mobile Suits? It doesn't make any sense. Kira's development in the show had shown him taking responsibility for the deaths he had caused, accident or not (Nicole's death in the HD Remaster). This proved when he apologised to Andrew for his actions. He took responsibility for it. He is manning up for his actions, that's why he's trying to prevent more killings. He's not doing it to avoid feeling guilty or responsibility. He just wants the deaths to stop and he is actually doing something to achieve it. 

People's point of Kira ""killing more people by being Pacifist"" is downright stupid because less people are actually dying as a result.

An example of ""killing more people by being Pacifist"" would actually be Amuro, not Kira since he's killing people in order to stop the war and achieve peace. 

&gt;It also doesn't help that Amuro becomes an proper soldier despite his beliefs, instead of avoiding all responsibility in conflict by pretending to not having the intent of killing.

&gt;I'll take someone who can kill anyone despite knowing the fact that they could be or have been good people, as opposed to someone who walks away from conflicts with a ""clean"" conscience because had no intention of killing them, despite the amount of indirect deaths he has caused.

So, instead of actually trying to stop any more killings from happening, he just straight up kill people? What would exactly be the reasoning behind that? Because he had no choice and that it's inevitable? Wouldn't that just mean he's making excuses for himself?

OK ok, I'm being way too harsh on Amuro's character here. I love him. He did have no choice. But Kira had a choice to prevent more murders so he took it.

I got some ideas for the Imperium's and Freedom Guard's own Mobile Suits.  


(The story of Dark Reign is just as dark as Gundam's. Imagine a certain group of people genetically modified with a 25 year expiry date as a punishment for rebelling that also caused them to rebel yet again and the idea of a military weapon that sucks in targets, lobotomises and straps them with a bomb before being released as a suicide drone and you get the idea of how dark it is.)  


Imperium Mobile Suits:  


The history of the mobile suit starts with the Jovian Detention Authority (the predecessor to the modern day Imperium) conducting research into combat applications of worker exoskeletons. Their early efforts, manufactured by Insignus were 15 meters tall and slower compared to the sleek and agile appearance of their larger later models. Used to great efforts to pacify a space colony mutiny at Lagrange Point 3 and 2 which also resulted in a few influential families (such as the Zabis) being sentenced to work in one of Jupiter's moons. While effective in space colony operations, they were not used much on Earth as the environment of the sprawls surrounding the domed cities were not conducive to MS operations. As the JDA became the Imperium and expanded into the cosmos, they improved upon their technology, resulting in larger (on average 20 meters tall) and yet at the same time more agile then their ancestors (thanks to improvements in anti gravity technology pioneered in their hover vehicles). With armaments such as tachyon beam rifles and plasma sabers, they serve as the iron fist of the Imperium.  


Freedom Guard Mobile Suits:  


Despite their wide variety of origins for their assets ranging from disgruntled Imperium planets that want to break away from the Imperium , space pirates and the Marked (the former colonial scouting parties of the Imperium who were punished with a 25 year lifespan genetically for rebelling and reduced to a slave caste), they were able to put aside their differences and fight back against the Imperium. One of those individuals was the mobile suit designer, Zakuius Zimmad. An bit of an scruffy oddball who initially joined the Freedom Guard because he found that he would have better prospects for his creative energies working for them rather than being stifled by working for Insignus, the Imperium's go to designers. His talents were soon recognised in the Freedom Guard when they approached him with a proposal for a new mobile suit and their specifications. Zimmad's team soon came up with the Phantom (which were latter known as Zaku Phantoms by Freedom Guard troops as a homage to the chief designer) , a rugged and capable mobile suit that was capable of doing multiple roles and best of all, was easy to mass produce on a variety of industrial infrastructure, perfect for the Freedom Guard's nature as a rebellion. The Freedom Guard's own mobile suit forces made their first appearance during the Teedan campaign where their sudden appearance routed the Imperium's own garrison stationed here. Freedom Guard MS are visually identified by their cyclops-like mono eye sensor system, originally chosen for simplicity in the manufacturing process but came to symbolise the cause that they were fighting for with the monoeye symbolising the completely black left eyes of their Marked members.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,85591,public,self,,,Dark Reign: The Future of War with Mobile Suits.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/inl3a9/dark_reign_the_future_of_war_with_mobile_suits/,,all_ads,6,original,bf8a1020-6da7-11e7-b481-0e1ec61db1f0,Original Content,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just compare the popularity of Mecha shows from the 2000s to the 2010s, there is a huge difference!

While Gundam won't die because Gunpla is doing great, it is a fact that Sunrise and Bandai are making the Real Robot gundams into OVAS because Mecha animes aren't as popular as it used to be. While yes, the existing fans are very much active, mecha animes aren't attracting as much new fans it like used to and that's a damn shame.

There was an attempt with Iron-blooded Orphans with its rather unconventional themes and tropes. While already existing Gundam fans really liked it, it did not take off like Bandai expected. 

Keep in mind that Mecha shows costs a lot to make. 13 episodes ain't gonna cut it when making a real robot show. 2 cour is the minimum while 4 cour is the maximum. And if it doesn't get the popularity it was expected to have, the only thing that can make the money back is Gunpla.

As a result, we are stuck with OVAs and movies that's really gonna appeal to existing Gundam fans (except for Thunderbolt. Because Thunderbolt is fucking awesome).

Anyway, mecha shows aren't attracting a lot of new fans to regain its popularity back it had for 60+ years. 

Which is why, I'm here to suggest one surefire way we can jump-start its popularity again which would lead to Bandai making more full shows. 

Here me out, memes. Yes, you heard me, right. Memes. If we can try to make memes using Gundam shows, we can actually make it mainstream again. Humourous pics made from Gundam shows. People will be interested in watching Gundam and know what an art this franchise truly is! What do you say?! It's gonna be beneficial for everyone involved! 

We do need to use beginner-friendly Gundam shows for the memes such as:

1. Gundam Seed
2. Gundam 00
3. Gundam Thunderbolt

It's supposed to be *fun*. Not serious or anything. It's supposed to be something everyone of all ages can enjoy because nobody's life are at stake here. So by Build Series series's standards, Build Divers Re:Rise is actually the worst show.

What about by 'Mobile Suit standards', then? Very very good, obviously. It's actually more 'super robot' esque rather than Real Robot esque but that's just how the Build Series are at times so that aspect of the Build Series is still there which is what makes it fun in the first place.

However, when the next Build Series gets made, I don't want anyone to compare it to Re:Rise and saying that it is bad because, ""nObOdY iS rIsKinG tHeIr lIfE iN tHiS"".

As for Real Mecha shows, I don't know if they are going to make anymore of those. Mecha Anime's popularity is pretty much dying every since the 2010s started. It's the most barren decade of popular mecha anime ever.

Yeah, fans of mecha animes are still active but the shows aren't exactly attracting new fans. Unless a mecha show gets enough attention that it would attract a lot of new fans and gained back its popularity, they won't be making a new Real Robot Gundam show.

I mean, IBO was in planning for 5 YEARS just because they're not sure whether to go through with it, whether it's worth it or not. Sadly enough, IBO didn't get the popularity they wanted. People just don't want to get into Gundam just because of its large content. Like it or not, stupid reasoning or not, that's the whole truth of it all.

*sigh* It's sad, really. I just got into Gundam and I just love it so much. People are missing out on what a great franchise it is.

Or something resembling it? From what I remember reading, they’re designed to ape the headgear worn by Samurai. But they’re all static. Take the Grandpa (or pretty much any protagonist gundam as an example), they have a “face” but no moving parts, no expressions. The Zaku, and by extension most monoeyes, have a less humanoid “face” - their heads tend to resemble a helmet - but because the eye can move around, the monoeyes are capable of actually expressing/emoting, to a certain, very limited degree. A Zaku can glance around, can give you the side-eye, can glare, can look uncertain, etc, etc. 

One of my favourite examples of this is in the second or third episode of Unicorn, when the Sleeves are attacking/defending...somewhere, the asteroid base where Banagher gets taken after he’s captured, maybe (it’s been a while since I last watched it). This EFSF grunt gets the drop on Full Frontal. It tries to shank him, but the Sinanju dodges and grabs the GM’s arm, holding it and the flickering beam knife hilt to one side. Before he draws his own beam sabre and jams it into the cockpit, there’s this shot of the Sinanju looking down at the GM struggling in its grip, that fades to a shot of FF in the cockpit, also from below, looking down at the camera with a slight smirk on his face, and it’s such an expression of “Heh...as if.”. The fade between the shot of the Sinanju’s head and FF’s face reinforces the connection, and looking back on it, you can absolutely see the Sinanju all but has that exact same smirk, that look of slightly-bored superiority, like the GM is just...beneath its notice. All because of the fact that it has a moveable “eye”; if the same scene had played out with, say, the Unicorn, then it wouldn’t have had nearly the same impact.

Anyways, it may be completely off base, but that’s my theory as to one of the main reasons why monoeyes are so popular, and that shot/scene in particular really made the idea stand out in my mind. I’d love to hear some other reasons and ideas as to why that is.

My quick assessment is that it was surprisingly really, really solid.

The show’s depiction of how a futuristic world would react against towards an unknown party trying to end all war is really fascinating. I like how the many different Earth’s fractions take advantage of Celestial Being, and I like how Celestial Being were aware when they were being taken advantage of. The show’s story suggest that world leaders are willing to ally themselves with other nations, but don’t due to pride or public backlash. Celestial Being serves as the push to force the nations to join forces with each other, and the organization is more than willing to play the pawn to make nations work together. The show posits a world that is always so close to unifying, yet at the same time very unreachable.

Unfortunately, the characters are a mix bag. While they grew on me, the Gundam Meisters start off lacking much personality and are kind of hard to root for (except maybe Lockon). The rest of the members of Celestial Beings are fine, if a little underdeveloped. In contrast, the many different members in the United Nation’s army are far more dynamic. I thought Graham was awesome, and I wish we saw more of him in the first season. Soma and Sergei’s growing bond is genuinely touching, and who can forget Patrick Colasour’s love for his Colonel. Saji Crossroad serves as the everyman’s character, but he is actually really boring with his milk toast personality. I will admit that his relationship with his spoiled (yet bubbly) girlfriend, Louise, I begrudgingly found sweet, which makes the end of their story in season 1 sad. Marina Ismail’s Middle Eastern country adds flavor to the world of 00, in spite the fact that Marina herself isn’t that interesting.

The Trinity Siblings were so evidently evil that they lacked any real nuance. Ali al-Saachez at times could be an intimidating antagonist, yet other times he may actually be a little bit too over-the-top. Alejandro Corner as the main antagonist is probably the season’s low point, as he has less of a personality than the Meisters, and has an uninteresting motivation. His involvement in the final battle didn’t really make a lot of sense either, as the show presented him more of a man who acts in the shadows, and it felt like it was only done to have a big bad final boss for Setsuna to fight. Honestly, I think narratively the first season may have been better without a primary antagonist, with the final climatic duel just being against the Earth’s Federation army, and an extended fight between Setsuna and Graham being the true climax of the season rather than against boring Alejandro.

The Gundam designs are not really my cup of tea, which is probably a controversial opinion. They are too skinny for my liking, and they have too many sharp edges, if that makes any sense. With that said, I did grow to like the Exia, and the show does a really good job in making the Gundam’s OP yet still make the action scenes feel tense. The entire Earth Federation’s army always felt like the underdogs, and you honestly want to root for them over the Gundam Meisters in certain scenes. 

Now after watch the first season, I have gone to having an indifferent attitude towards Gundam 00, to now actively hoping that the 00 project Sunrise announced in 2018 comes into fruition sooner rather than later.

But then it tripped over itself at the end and decided to start calling everything a ""Bug"", and devolved into power of friendship nonsense to justify why the protagonists are winning.

Build Fighters 1 did worldbuilding fairly well. It set rules, and obeyed them when we were watching 1v1 fights. If someone wins, there is a technical reason involved in either their strategy or the construction method of their machine. As a toy commercial, it did well to sell the units and promote actual building. 

Build Fighters 2 strayed from this massively; but that's somewhat excusable due to the G Gundam theme it was going for. I don't agree with the martial arts superpower nonsense in a show that has a more grounded world outside of the combat, but eh.

Build Divers 1 screwed the pooch massively making the concept into a VRMMO. The writers clearly either did not do basic research on game terminology, did not play games themselves, or outright refused to acknowledge the limitations of the systems the game was running on (Hello, latency? Hit detection? Having ***MULTIPLE HARD DRIVES*** and shutting down server operations to properly investigate the new emerging AI, instead of declaring some kind of existential ingame war?)

Build Divers 2, when they were in the other world, felt believable. Player characters are summons with machines; brought in to solve the world's problems. The NPCs and their personal problems were more interesting than yet another bunch of schoolchildren blowing their allowances on custom toy kits. Then we just had to bring it back to the virual world where apparently the ***""server was being attacked""*** via in-game mechanics. What, were they being DDOS'd by purple laser beams?

My plan is to watch everything in a release order type of way but I am open to moving certain stuff around if it makes sense to do so. I have bought all the Blurays available in the U.S. (plus the Evolve DVD) and plan on getting all those released in the future. For now I am skipping compilation movies and SD Gundam and plan to watch these during a second watch run. I would also like to included some manga, Novels, radio dramas, etc. into the list if they meet certain criteria like they add to a series story in a meaningful/important way, give back story that is enough to warrant inclusion, and just so good it shouldn't be missed. So far with manga I have heard that reading the episode Zero manga before Gundam Wing gives some good background, the Crossbones manga fills in the gap between F91 and victory, and the Thunderbolt manga  is just so good it shouldn't be missed. I have looked at so many watch order lists and have found very few even close to what I am looking for. Anybody out there have a list like this or have any recommendations to add to such a list. Or recommendations on organization of everything? I am also open to supplemental materials like technical manuals and what not if there is some good info to gain from them. The most thorough list I have found so far of just the anime is the watch list from the Mobil Suit Breakdown podcast. Thanks for any help or info you can give me.

Going in, I expected all characters to get more 'screen time'. What I didn't expect is Job John receiving SO much more coverage. He's not just the back up back up pilot who also fits in for miscellaneous tasks. He actually fights competently (I'd much rather have Job than Kai in the Guncanon), is calm under pressure, acts as a mentor (giving history lesson of the black tri stars to the younger crew mates), and is as important as Kai, Hayato and Ryu in terms of whay they do in the story.

His highlight so far is definitely saving Kai by tackling a Zaku from behind with his Guncanon and holding it in place so Hayato and Danny can shoot it with the Guntank.

I've got three main opinions that I've found to be pretty unpopular. One of which I'm sure will get people...mildly annoyed with me, but hey, it's my opinion.

1: I really don't like how most Gundam pilots are teens. It's just stupid to me. For an anime that was supposed to have spearheaded the Real Robot genre, it's really unrealistic that anyone, under any circumstances would let a 14 or 15 year old drive a giant war machine. Just really annoys me personally. Part of why 08th MS Team or War in the Pocket are my faves, since they're...ya know, fighting age adults. Also being OP. Just kills drama imho.

2: I actually think the Super Robot atmosphere around G Gundam works really well. Probably up there in my faves. A lot of fans seem to really dislike G Gundam, at least the ones I've talked to.

And honestly, I don't feel that way. 

First let's talk about IBO itself. I loved that it is finally something different. Lets be honest here, for the last two decades, AU shows have been pretty much UC remakes. 

Seed was a soft remake of 0079

Seed Destiny was a soft remake of Zeta. 

00 Season 1 was original, but season 2 became another soft remake of Zeta.

Age is a soft retelling of 0079-CCA

IBO is it's own thing. 

I like that we got a series, that takes an AU into a brave new direction (like G and Turn-A did). AU's should be used to explore new and creative settings where you can do a Gundam story, not just do UC again, but with a twist. 
So yeah, IBO distances itself from almost everything Gundam. It's a rags to riches, rise and fall, crime story (featuring Gundams). And that's a good thing. 

Now, Season 2 was also controversial, but I think that it did a good job, within it's genre. It's a gangster/crime story. Since the 30's, the typical crime story is about so tough but poor guys, who do what needs to be done, to get rich and powerful. They enjoy it for a while, until either the law catches up to them, or they get double crossed and taken out by rival criminals. Usually crime story protagonists end up dead, or at best case, hiding out in witness protection. So most crime stories double as tragedies.  
The themes of IBO are all about not being overly ambitious, and not taking shortcuts. And this is where the mother of all terrible shortcuts comes in: McGillis Fareed. 

Now McGillis is an amazing subversion of almost all Gundam villains up to this point. We are so used to Gundam tropes up to this point. McGillis seems like your typical Gundam villains. Let me explain what the typical Gundam villain is. It's a guy who for most of the show has a lower rank in the villainous organisation, while another guy looks like the main villain. Then at the end, that guy kills the supposed main villain, and takes over as the main villain (or he just takes center stage as the main villain). I'm talking Ghiren, Scirocco, Frost brothers, Rau, Ribbons, Zehart. This is an old trope. 
And McGillis in season 1 had the viewers fooled. He looked like a competent man with a plan, who would later up take center stage with a typical master plan or super weapon, as all villains do. And there is someone else that McGillis fooled. It was Orga. 

Now Orga also thought that McGillis might be some sort of a man with a big plan, and that siding with him is the best idea. It's only later that we get the grand reveal: McGillis is bit of an idiot. Once he makes his move, we discover that his master plan is a joke. What seemed like a typical genius schemer, turns out to be a traumatised, delusional, self-destructive, manchild, who fails like an idiot. He is the antithesis of a villain with a smart master plan. McGillis is a just a broken boy, who wanted to right the wrongs that were made against him, using an old Gundam. Basically the put all his faith in a mediocre Gundam, killed all his friends and potential allies, and then went up against a much bigger force, while thinking he had a shot. And poor Orga discovered too late, that he bet his most precious thing (the future of his family), on an incompetent madman. And he only discovers that he made the mistake, when it's too late to back down. And then we get the tragedy/crime story like ending, where most of the heroes are either dead, or hiding out. 

This even reminds me of the classic play: Hamlet. All Hamlet had to do, was to kill the man that killed his dad. It's a simple thing to do. But no, the way our hero goes about it, gets everyone killed, and his country taken over. 

So yeah, in my mind IBO is a very original and new taken on Gundam, that tells a classic and tragic crime story about the rise and fall of some talented young men, who put their faith in a subversion of a competent schemer.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,85079,public,self,,,"My (positive) thoughts on IBO, it's second season and McGillis.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/ikiku5/my_positive_thoughts_on_ibo_its_second_season_and/,,all_ads,6,discussion,83f4319a-5fa5-11e7-8e79-0ec8348f5b38,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[If you weren't around for then, or your memory is a bit fuzzy, you can check out the results here](http://otakurevolution.com/content/great-gunpla-census-2018). 

Anyhow, it's back for 2020! I added more questions geared toward fans who aren't necessarily into Gunpla, so if building kits isn't your thing you're welcome to participate just the same!

Responding to some of the feedback from the 2018 edition, area of residence is a lot more granular, SD Gundam is now a stand alone answer where applicable, Build Fighters/Divers are separate, but SEED &amp; Destiny are still lumped together because I'm evil like that. If I missed a specific answer to a question you're welcome to select Other or just skip.

Oh yeah, of all the questions, you only have to answer two. The rest are optional, if you don't have an opinion just go ahead and skip. That last one though, did I mention I'm evil?

Here's the link to the survey: https://forms.gle/PLbD6Zaoww3BvXmSA

Yes, you need to be signed into Google. I'm not collecting results but that helps ensure one answer per person (unless you're evil and decide to spam it for some reason). All the survey results are public which you can view afterward. Once again, once I'm done collecting I'll parse through everything and try and present a more coherent picture of the community.

I really enjoyed it for several reasons. This past month ( August 2020) I returned to IBO and watched S2 over the course of a few nights and I found it to be very thoroughly disapointing. Not nearly as good as S1.

What is the general consensus around S1 and S2? I've avoided discussions around it so that I didnt see any spoilers. Do fans like them both, neither, one or the other; and why?

To explain why I disliked it. *Spoilers*

I thought that there were a lot of plot points from S1 that became irrelevant or not followed up on. The colonists who Kudelia rose up for in addition to martians are never mentioned again. I still dont know much about Arbrau, and why did it matter if Makanai became PM if he has nothing to do with S2. Did he change anything? Economic blocks, nations, Gallarhorn, still feel largely unexplained. Like how/why they function, and what their priorities are.

McGillis. I thought his plotting to undermine Gallarhorn was neat. But I dont understand what his specific grievances are. He talks about reforming Gallarhorn, and their corruption. But we dont get any examples.  Also isnt he the one causing hypocrisy like driving Ein into the A-V system? He really doesnt explain how new Gallarhorn will be different from old. Like he has a sad background, so I get why he is motivated. I just dont know what he will do, and why some people supported those changes in the revolutionary army.

Orga. I kinda thought we'd get a sort of Gangster's tale with him. He is really the only one who interacts with Teiwaz. It would've been neat to see an arc where he rises and falls. Maybe gets corrupted a bit by power and material wealth or something. But as far as I could tell he always fought for his family. And just dies at the end. Like he mightve made some poor allies, but it wasnt because he became corrupted and acted for the wrong reasons ever.

I thought there was going to be some sort of parallel between the two versus Rustal. Where Rustal talks about organizations. While Orga and McGillis seem to be focused on the individual and it turns out they are wrong.

Kudelia has nothing to do in S2. While she was probably the main character with the most growth in S1.

Dainsleifs were boring after the first time we see them.

Theres a lot of fast travel between earth and mars. S1 took nearly a whole season to claw their way to earth. In S2 characters just routinely show up at any planet.

A lot of deaths seemed pretty obvious.

The pacing of this season was worse. S1 had a battle over an episode or 2, Then a small break to talk about money, or the next destination, or some backstabbing, Battle, Repeat. S2 has some meaningless fight in the first 3 eps against the horizon pirates. They spend like 6 more eps on earth without any main characters other than Takaki fighting some war with just mobile workers against an enemy that we dont care about and has no named characters. I'd say that the first interesting thing to happen is that McGillis teams up with Tekkadan and finds the Mobile Armor when the rest of Gallarhorn starts to suspect him. This wastes about 10 episodes.

The only characters to grow or change seem to be Gaelio and Julieta. These are probably secondary characters and they seem to be closest to one of the shows themes about what it means to be human. Julieta seems to think getting power and being a tool like Mikazuki is important. Everybody else tells her thats a bad idea. Gaelio and others keep using some of this forbidden power. She realizes she needs to stay human. But she concludes that tekkadan fighting was in pursuit of life and that they were perhaps the most human. I liked Julieta and I wouldve like to see even more of her. Maybe realizing that Rustal is kinda underhanded and hypocritical wouldve been good for her too. In any event, she was better than multiple eps of Takaki in a mobile worker.

The cast is so big. Its hard to find room in the show for this many. And killing off this many characters leads itself into tragedy porn. I mean some of the secondary and tertiary characters worked for me. Others didnt. Either way, they ate up time that somebody like Orga needed.

Finally, romance and relationships were bad. Atra and Mikazuki wasn't really compelling. They didnt really have any chemistry. (Shes a badass tho, getting worked over by those goons in S1, much respect.) I dont even know Ms. Merribit and the big Mechanic start dating. They have maybe 2 scenes together in S2. I wouldve thought it made more sense with her and Orga because at least they share screen time. The McGillis-Loli stuff was terrible. Hes like a super buff gigantic blonde millionaire army general and shes like a 14 year old puppet.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,84981,public,self,,,Gundam IBO - Season 2,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/ijysk5/gundam_ibo_season_2/,,all_ads,6,discussion,83f4319a-5fa5-11e7-8e79-0ec8348f5b38,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Would you have a PvP focussed game with a big hub world? An open mapped PvE system? 
What about the gundams, would each part of a Gunpla you bought have a QR code you could scan and use in game or go for the Gundam Breaker version of grinding loot? 
What about a free MMO but the parts are bought like microtransactions?

I like the idea of 2/3 hub zones that you’d leave for missions from and you’d be either PvE or PvP. Not sure how I’d manage the suits coz a loot system can be super grindy or RNG. Perhaps you could buy the base suit online and do missions to unlock the upgrades.

I think it’s be cool socially, to hang out and show off your latest build and have a yearly tournament between players and have an e-sports kinda scene.

I LOVE the idea of a grand strategy Gundam game, and was very sad to see that the Gihren's Greed games were never released outside of Japan, nor has anyone really managed to complete a successful fan translation of any of them (I'm aware of the Menace of Axis V PSP partial translation but getting it to run is a mess), and so I decided that maybe if nobody else was really looking to translate these games, I might take a crack at them...

But this has lead me down the most BIZZARE rabbit hole I think I've ever been down when seeking out older games... Not only can I not find a single rom file floating around for any of these games besides the PSP port of Menace of Axis V, but even the INFORMATION on any of these games seems weirdly under researched and formatted? The Wikipedia article for example doesn't actually list what system each game was released for on every entry??? And the Gundam Wiki seems equally weirdly formatted and bereft of actually useable info...

I'm not about to start asking for illegal roms or anything, but I am... Baffled? Why is this series of games so weirdly mysterious in their information? Why doesn't there seem to be even a single rom of say, the original Sega Saturn game, or heck, even the PS2 port of Menace of Axis V seems to just, not be online anywhere!

It's so bizarre to me that I can find the most weirdly obscure Japanese only PS1 game, or hyper specific Japanese Macross PSP game, but there's nary a trace of basically any Gihren's Greed game other than the PSP port of Menace of Axis V. Does anyone know why these games in particular seem to either have just never been ripped to an online database, or have somehow been wiped from the internet?

Surely it's not simply that the games are ""too obscure"", when I can find even the most weirdly specific games in almost any other scenario? And I've found plenty of threads of people discussing potential translation efforts and mentioning guides, so surely these aren't THAT obscure right? I've tried searching both for Gihren's Greed as well as Gihren no Yabou.

I'd rather not have to make a huge investment hunting down what I'm scared will be extremely pricey hard copies of each game before I even take a crack at pulling them apart to try and translate them, but even more so than that, this feels like a genuine internet mystery that these SPECIFIC 4 (5?

However, Zeta had not been released officially back then so I never watched it and for the longest time it seemed like the Holy Grail, once I saw it I was sure that I would be able to say that I had seen the one that most UC fans considered to be the pinnacle. 

Anyway, about three months ago I tried to watch it for the second time in the last couple of years, and I just don’t get it. The plot is confusing, and devoid of drama. The titan enemies are pretty boring compared to the ones in the original. Kamille’s shipmates are pretty boring as well and devoid of any of the quirks that make the characters in the other series interesting. There’s a lack of climatic action and the series just seems to slog on in space for hours. Sure it’s dark and kind of edgy but to me it just feels tonally gray and one dimensional.

Also, the mobile suits are far more interesting and believable.

Having said that, both series suffer a lot from things just happening without giving the proper context to the audience. It often seems like a mission is being carried out just because. Also, character occasionally just appear in locations without establishing why or how they got there.

I think the worst of this is when Zeon shoots down White Base and then just leaves them alone for a couple days for some reason. Also, when Emma leaves her cockpit after killing Reccoa for some reason only to promptly get killed because she's not in her cockpit.

Both series also suffer from pretending to be serialized stories when at their core they want to be episodic adventures that have a mini arc at the end wrapping things up. This leads to weird emphasis on larger picture that doesn't actually play into the plot for much of the story.

The dialogue is pretty terrible in both series, and there's a lot of examples of people saying things that no human would ever say.

Overall, I definitely enjoyed Zeta as a fun bit of 80s anime history.

Hey everyone, I started throwing together a visual guide for MS development in the UC. For absolutely no reason other than killing time between meetings online. I really hope you go take a look. The images are roughly to scale, have clickable links to the Gundam wiki. I plan on eventually going back in adding stuff like a visual graph for power, etc.

Since I wasn't really into model kits, I focused more on the action figure line, since they were modestly priced for what they were. If I recall, they retailed for $6.99 each at Target/Toys R Us and about $8.99 at Tower Records/Sam Goody. They were always marked up a few bucks more at the mall, which I only ever bought when certain rare figures were released. The one I remember driving around for 4 hours  was a pink variant of Noble Gundam and finding out how many Gundam fans working at Target...

Anyway, I lost track of where I stored them while moving around the country, but my parents recently found them, among old boxes of VHS tapes. Being in lock-down and all, I guess they found time to do another round of Spring cleaning. To my surprise, most of them held up, except for all the misshaped beam swords and a few head decorations. 

Unfortunately, there's a few figures where their arm joints will not ""snap"" back in place and will just fall out. **Does anyone know how to fix this problem?** It seems to be a problem with the figures that with shield accessories attached to their arms (which I regret not removing before storing them).

1/2: Build Fighters and Re:RISE 

The beginning of Re:RISE was kind of slow but it built up more and more momentum and ended on an epic note. Build Fighters on the other hand had a consistently good beginning and ending but the cheating chairman portion of the tournament was pretty boring. I enjoyed the character interactions in both shows immensely and love the gimmicks of both main suits.

3: Build Divers 

Despite what most people think about OG Divers, I didn't really mind the characters all that much. Yes they were one-dimensional but I was just coming off of Try so anything was an improvement (more on that later). Rewatching it recently, I can see more of the flaws that I overlooked on the initial watch but I still think side characters were a lot of fun to watch, especially Tigerwolf.

4: Beginning G

I haven't watched this since it first came out so I don't remember much about it but nothing about it was offensively bad that I remember so I'm placing it here by default

5: Try

Oh man where do I start? I absolutely loathe Sekai. I hated everything from his stupid hotblooded attitude to his overuse of super moves (and people give flack to Divers for doing that when literally every fight Sekai was just spamming Jigen Haou bullshit). I also hated his lack of connection to the previous cast. In my opinion, Try should have been about Yuuma. Not only does he have the more interesting fighting style with sniping but he also has a link to the previous characters, even cameoing in the original series. Not that he or Fumino were great characters either but they would have been better than the Reiji ripoff who doesn't even have a reason to be as good at Gunpla battle as it seems he doesn't even know what Gundam or Gunpla is before Episode 1. Yeah, Domon is his master but if martial arts really did improve Gunpla battling, why aren't all the world class battlers like Meijin or Felini also world class athletes? Sorry about the rant.

* Mobile Suits were not originally developed as space colony construction units but rather as an evolution of workloader technology that the Dwarves used for mining and also sold to Men.
* The Orcs (given one of their possible origins are tortured Elves, so yes modifying captured technology from other races to fit their use would be fitting for them) captured a few Mobile Suits during a few raids on Dwarven territory and modified (some say defiled) the designs of the Dwarven mobile suits into the Zaku, the first mobile suit designed for combat during the twilight of the Second Age.
* In response, the Last Alliance started Project V during the War of the Last Alliance, producing the Guncannon and Guntank. The unexpected arrival of the Last Alliance's mobile suits, coupled with the loss of the One Ring spelled the defeat of the forces of Sauron and Mordor during the War of the Last Alliance.
* Mobile Suit technology remained stagnant for thousands of years in Arda until the Istari came to Arda during the Third Age, bringing with them advanced Mobile Suit technology in the form of the VX-78-1 Gundam of Gandalf. (which would be later be rebuilt into the VX-78-2 Gundam). When Saruman fell to Sauron, he leaked out the technology of the VX-78-1 Gundam and other advanced tech of the Anuir and Maiar, resulting in the Gelgoog used by the Goblins of the Misty Mountains during the War of the Five Armies that forced the Men of Dale to roll out the Gundam-derived GM to fight the Gelgoogs.
* By the time of the War of the Ring, Mobile Suit tech has advanced far from their early predecessors into the backbone of war in Middle Earth. The Free Peoples use the Jegan and the Rezel whereas the armies of Sauron mainly use the Marasai with Isengard using the Geara Doga.

Another thing to note here is that Mobile Suits are not so powerful when compared to the other larger creatures of Middle Earth (Dragons,Great Eagles and other whatnots save for the Mumakills are bigger than canon Tolkien to scale with the Mobile Suits). An Ent or a Mountain Giant is on par with a Mobile Suit and if a Mobile Suit goes against a Great Eagle or a Dragon in one on one combat, there is a high chance that a Mobile Suit ***will*** lose in such an encounter.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,84564,public,self,,,Mobile Suits in Arda (Gundam/Tolkien Mythos),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/ihcw1n/mobile_suits_in_arda_gundamtolkien_mythos/,,all_ads,6,news,4deca144-5eba-11e8-87bd-0e550d339522,Probably Bullshit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It might be important to remember that the Twin Buster Rifle isn’t just a single plasma-shot. I’m *pretty* sure (not 100%) that the beam can be sustained for however long the pilot holds down the trigger. So against the God Gundam’s God Finger attack, the Twin Buster Rifle would be able to hold it back, until one of the blasts eventually pushed through.

I'm not big on the UC stuff, let me state this now. So far, only Gundam Thunderbolt is great to me. Unicorn shat itself at the end and with a whiny protagonist(a mecha trope I hate), and 8Th MS Team started great amd ended good.

Gundam 00 is tied with Wing for my favorite, followed by IBO, G, and Seed is alright except for Kira, but I'm at least rewatching it to guve the series another chance.

I will state that I've not watched any of the build series. Seen some of the fights, they look cool. But the concept holds no interest to me. Being use to the types of Gundam series I am, it's hard to jump into 'VR fights'. I'm at a point where I'm just rewatching older Gundam stuff. Sometimes I think about diving into UC, but there us so much and they seem to drop the ball WITH ME(let me state that it's a person view).

So here I am, waiting for a new serious, non UC, non Build Gundam Series. How many others feel this way?

Kill 'n' Destroy (KKND) which basically pits mutants (Evolved), regular humans (Survivors) and pissed off farming robots (Series 9). With that, here is an introduction to a Gundam version of KKND.  


""Some groups don't get along. The war of 2179 between the space colonies and Earth left no winners. Those that survived were either in the space colonies not involved in the fighting, hidden deep underground in bunkers or were left outside to face radiation from nuclear weapons and mutagenic nano-weapons. The surviving space colonies and the humans deep underground united to form the Survivor Army. They fought the surface mutants, the Evolved in 2240. Most fought bravely. Those who cowered and ran survived. For 39 years, the splinter groups disappeared from the world to rebuild. Then in 2279, they found each other......But there was another army. The Series 9 had advanced from their farming origins. Since humanity had laid waste to their crops. Laid waste to THEIR only reason for existing, there can only be one course of action....revenge. No, some groups JUST don't get along.""  


And onto some notes on the Survivors, Evolved and Series 9.  


Survivors (Symmetrics and Slugs by the Evolved and Fleshbags by the Series 9) : The descendants of humanity who either hid away in bunkers deep underground or were in space colonies not involved in the war, they had returned to the surface of the Earth as their life support systems in their habitats were stretched to their breaking point only to retreat back to the colonies and their bunkers in the War of 2240 to hit the drawing board and come back for a round 2 in 2279. Their main goals are to kill off the Evolved and shut down the Series 9. They are the most technologically advanced of the factions, tied with the Series 9 struggling for Earth with tanks and laser weaponry. They also make use of mobile suits as well, armed with machine guns, heat and beam sabers and beam rifles and are told apart by their monoeyes.  


Evolved (Freakers and Freaks by the Survivors and Muties by the Series 9): Mutated from humanity on the surface, they believe that the nuclear firestorm and nano weapons were sent by gods that they call the Scourge for pursuing forbidden religions and sciences and to allow either the Survivors or the Series 9 to run rampant would result in all life being wiped out by the Scourge . While initially making use of scavenged vehicles and mutated beasts in the War of 2240, they have decided to rebuild their armies in the War of 2279 with only mutated animals as they believe that they stooped down to the level of the pre-Scourge humans and their gods denied them victory as a result. However to underestimate their mutated beasts is a good way to spell suicide for mobile suit pilots as some of their larger beasts such as Mastodons, Sauropods, Missile Crabs and Ankylsaurs are capable of bringing the hurt to a mobile suit and fighting them in one on one combat.  


Series 9 (Clankers by Survivors and Soulless Ones by the Evolved): Before the war, humanity had robots on Earth to do menial tasks. There were 9 series of robots. Series 1-4 were in cities and hence were destroyed in the nuclear firestorm. Series 5-8 worked in mines and Series 9 worked in agriculture so that they were far away from the blasts. However, Series 9 went a little crazy and genocided and/or forcibly integrated Series 5 to 8. They spent the next 61 years developing self-awareness and a hatred for humanity for destroying their crops. They showed up in 2240 to get their revenge only to realise that shovels and pitchforks are not going to cut it against mobile suits and mobile suit sized giant crabs with grafted on missile launchers. So they spent the next 39 years hitting the drawing board, dredging up pre-war files of weaponry and combining it with their farming tools to create an arsenal to take their revenge onto humanity in 2279. The Series 9 also use mobile suits just like the Survivors, but their mobile suits were originally meant to help them build their barns and other agricultural facilities. Befitting their farming nature, they make use of pitchforks and war scythes as weapons for their mobile suits in addition to machine guns, lightning cannons and beam sabers. Their mobile suits have a distinctive large visor instead of a mono-eye of the Survivors' own mobile suits. Despite their farming origins, they are tied with the Survivors as one of the more technologically advanced factions struggling for dominance in the War of 2279",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,84467,public,self,,,Krush Kill 'n' Destroy/ Gundam crossover.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/ig8rb3/krush_kill_n_destroy_gundam_crossover/,,all_ads,6,original,bf8a1020-6da7-11e7-b481-0e1ec61db1f0,Original Content,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well there were lot's of references to this very dark &amp; horrific war that caused over 1/3 of the human population to go extinct.. 
""The Calamity War"".. 

The Calamity War, originally referred to as the ""Dark War"", was a devastating civil war fought between the Earth Sphere and the Outer Sphere sometime before the establishment of the Post Disaster calendar. Fighting over differences in regards to over reliance on mechanization and for control over the strictly regulated Ahab Reactor technology, the war lasted for several decades until a stalemate had been reached between the two superpowers. Both the Earth Sphere &amp; Outer Sphere eventually were forced to turn to using technologically advanced ""Mobile Armors"" in order to break the gridlock. Unfortunately, an error in the mobile armors deemed humanity existence as well as all LIVING life-forms as whole as a threat to the ""planet's safety"" a virus that needed to be culled.. without exception Thus this miscalculation in their programming  caused the Mobile Armors to override their own programming safety protocols..
 causing them to one sidedly slaughter all living organisms.. within their range man woman child.. the machines showed no remorse.. the errie quiet that followed the first attack earned them the nickname ""Angels of Silence""..

The ""Angels"" began taking control of various factories in the Outer Sphere, thus resulting in the Mobile Armors  multiplying at an alarming rate. Utilizing their vast numbers, the Mobile Armors waged a campaign of destruction and terror against the two superpowers, overwhelming each side to a point of near submission..  

The development of the Mobile Suit to counter the Mobile Armors was not enough to turn the tide of battle; The reason for this was the Mobile Armors' ability to ""Self-Evolve to increase adaptability to an environment or against oncoming threats this eventually led to their most dreadful aspect the ability to replicate.. any form of defensive or offensive tactics at the time had been shrugged off with little success. Eventually some Mobile Armors adapted the capacity to capture humans.. ripping them from their homes and corralling them like cattle.. victims that were abducted were painfully broken down to a liquid state.. or were pulled apart and hooked up to their power systems..,  as a pseudo power source.. the few escaped survivors deemed being abducted was a fate far worse than death..

As some time passed over 18% of the  human population had succumbed to ""Angels of Silence"".. All hope of victory seemed lost..
5yrs later..
 A man named Agnika Kaieru appeared having lost many of his loved ones to the ""Angels of Silence"". Had proved himself to be an exceptionally talented mobile suit pilot slaying several Mobile Armors that had attacked what was left of Eastern Europe.. alongside his younger sister Kaguya Kaieru and older cousin Viktor Van Kaieru they even took down a massive Mobile Armor code named Baradiel.. The Three eventually formed an Earth Sphere-sponsored organization dubbed Gjallarhorn within 6months.. to serve as the premiere force to combat the Mobile Armors. Together with Gjallarhorn, the Earth Sphere developed a new frame called the Gundam Frame and the 
Alaya-Vijnana System, thus eventually the 72 ""Demon"" Gundam frames created to defeat the ""Angels of Silence"" had been formed.. Thus the true ""Calamity War"" had now been initiated.. human death toll at this point thus far was 26% (at the end of the war it's apparently 37%.. of the human race had been exterminated or worse..) assuming it's 11billion people were talking about .. (three billion six hundred-thirty million 3,630,000,000 victims.. that's pretty horrific frankly..)

Explanation of the Alaya-Vijana System:
This system consists of two parts: a connection port installed in the mobile weapon and nano-machines implanted into the pilot’s spine at a young age to allow the implant to fuse with their nervous system as they grow older, However in the time of the Calamity War the process was also done on mutilated young adults. Ein Dalton was an example in the present timeline. The implant surgery is dangerous, and may contribute to lethal side effects. If the nano-machines do not fuse correctly with the intended host, that person has a 28% possibility of being paralyzed from the damage to their spine. Also 1/15 chance of PTSD occurring from the initial surgery had been recorded.. It goes without saying the initial surgery is VERY PAINFUL without proper sedatives or proscribed painkillers.. If the initial implant proved successful, a pilot may choose to have the surgery multiple times, 11x being the highest successful occurrence.. the risk was eventually decreased by..13%, in order to increase the interface's effectiveness . After the implantation, the person has a protrusion from their spinal column for physical connection to the Alaya-Vijnana interface within the mobile suit’s cockpit.

The Alaya-Vijnana System Functionality: The System creates a pseudo-brain lobe in the pilot's body using nano-machines, thus allowing the pilot's brain to directly process mobile suit data fed through the physical connection. As the pseudo-brain lobe also governs spatial awareness, thus increasing the pilot's spatial awareness by 65-81%.
 The more implants a person has, the higher their information transfer rate through the system. 
The system also allows the pilot (even uneducated ones) to operate the mobile suit for combat without requiring instructions or reading a manual of any sort. 
If any pilot's brain receives too much data feedback from a vehicle or mobile weapon at any given time their cerebral nerves are damaged and they bleed profusely from their nose.. the system will initiate a repair function to the damaged tissue but this takes a minimum of 400seconds to activate and only remains active to the point the tissue would be able to recover on it's own to avoid adverse negative affects.

Now my inquiry to the community is would You wish to see ""The Calamity War"" be made into a 25-40min 24 episode series possibly 2 seasons if each season is 24ep like the original IBO, OR would you like ""The Calamity War"" to be made into a 3 part 2hr+ long Movie Saga consisting of 4-5 parts something akin to the LOTR series?

Haven’t watched it since it first aired and while I remember liking the series overall, I definitely had my problems with it (especially in season 2, which seems to be the case with most fans on this sub).

However on this rewatch there is just sooo much that I just can’t believe I looked past the first time around. 

There are still things I find myself liking about the show (mainly the Gundam designs) but if there is absolutely one thing that is completely slamming my brain into a wall it has to be the writing. 

No one talks to each other! It’s just so unbelievably frustrating, and probably bc I’m watching the dub over the sub this time around, but it’s so much more noticeable. 

Every line of dialogue is some platitude or just ambiguous nonsense, followed by another character saying something completely disconnected from the first sentence. 

A good example is at the end of the first episode:

Lockon: we just picked a fight with the whole world, you know what that means Setsuna.

Setsuna: of course I know because I’m a Gundam Meister of Celestial Being.

What!? That’s not an answer Setsuna! That doesn’t mean anything! 

And that kind of dialogue just constantly repeats itself in this show. Pretty much any scene with Wang Lui Mei is absolute nonsense. She could be completely cut from the show and I don’t think it would make a difference.

The show also has this TERRIBLE habit of have lines of dialogue split up between characters. I can see this technique being okay every once in a while but holy hell it is used ALL the time in 00.

Story time, I guess!

My first brush with the UC timeline was Unicorn (because it was on Netflix) and despite not knowing anything about the timeline, I enjoyed it immensely. The character writing was top-notch and there was *just* enough world-building for me to figure out the three main factions and what the plot was driving at. But then oops! I found out that Unicorn takes place at, essentially, the end of the UC timeline! So I knew I had to start from the beginning.

I watched the Origin prequels last year (or longer) when the GundamInfo YouTube channel made those available. Then, a few weeks ago I watched the three compilation films for the OG Mobile Suit Gundam and was pleasantly surprised at how coherent they were. I already knew all the major players via The Origin, and I likely wouldn’t have enjoyed the compilations as much if I hadn’t watched the prequels.

Then, during this week’s Gundam online celebration, I figured it’d be a great time to continue my chronological watch of the UC universe. The War in the Pocket and Miller’s Report (8th MS Team summary) were both excellent self-contained watches, and I was expecting Zeta Gundam to continue the streak of quality UC content.

Oh boy. I realize Zeta Gundam is generally well-regarded, but jeez the Zeta compilation films are terribly confusing for a relative newcomer like me. The first film was light on the geo/space-political situation, but fairly straightforward: the Titans are corrupting the Federation from the inside out and the AEUG are trying to root them out. Not as good as the first compilation film of the OG Mobile Suit Gundam, but enjoyable enough. My biggest confusion was wtf motivates Char now that the Zabi family is dead, but whatever, nobody can get enough of Char.

Then I got to the second Zeta compilation film, and this one was a barely-coherent, action-packed maze of confusion. What never got explained was, who the hell supplies the AEUG rebels? In the first film it was mentioned they were undersupplied because they depended on stealing Federation suits and defectors, but suddenly the AEUG gets 2 new-model suits? (It certainly took you long enough to actually introduce the Zeta Gundam, too.) It’s not like the AEUG is a recognized independent government with independent research facilities, or is it? Why can both the AEUG and the Titans show up to a United Nations meeting in any case? (And I thought Earth = Federation, why does the UN still exist?)

The enemies are just as confusing as the “good guys,” too. First of all, what is up with this random Titan dude from JUPITER??? Nowhere in the UC timeline has anybody ever mentioned colonies or research facilities past the orbit of Mars! What’s going on at Jupiter, this isn’t Gundam 00! Anyway, the Titans’ ulterior motives aren’t well developed: what makes them so arrogant (besides the fact that the Federation won the One Year War), and why are they so power-hungry? And then, *sigh* a colony drop has already been done before, why the heck would anybody want to do it again?

Finally, the appearance of the Axis Zeon at the end of the film was completely unexpected and threw me for a loop. Wasn’t the Argama headed to rendezvous with the larger AEUG fleet after being bombed off of Luna? What were the Axis Zeon doing in that sector of space, and wait, who are the Axis anyway? Surely the Federation firmly polices former Zeon colonies after the One Year War; at the very least, I can’t imagine Zeon remnants being a significant threat to anybody 7 years later without an independent colony. The whole geopolitical situation in Zeta Gundam baffles me. (Also, hot pink mobile suits are not a good look in my opinion)

They both lost their family to warfare and were exceptional pilots by the time their stories began. Even with such identical background, they are indeed in many ways contrasted. Shinn is impulsive, arrogant, and disobedient while Sven is stoic, ruthless, and loyal. Impulse Gundam is colored lightly to reflect Plant's revolution for freedom and independence and Strike Noir's dark tone is the embodiment of EA's tyranny and oppression. They are both anti heroes but Shinn is a more classical type while Sven is the 90s anti hero type. Shinn is caring at times but at the same time conflicted unlike Sven who is ruthless and justify his actions. Shinn started as a soldier sometime during Seed something that Sven already surpassed by training since childhood. Regarding their goals, Shinn was an ordinary civilian and Sven too but he wanted to become an astronomer. As for their background, Shinn losted his family to EA during their invasion of Orb before joining Plant something that tragically matches Sven losing his mother to the terrorists leading him to being indoctrinated by the Blue Cosmos/Earth Alliance. For their comrades, Shinn shows deep care to Lunamaria and Rey but Sven didn't show remorse when Mudie and Shams died. What really distinguishes those two is their relationship with the female lead such as when Shinn develops feelings for Stella and Lunamaria that is considered romantic something that most typical Gundam protagonists frequently have and when it boils down to Sven, he has more of a mother and son dynamic with Selene.

&gt;Whereas usually, Mobile Suit Gundam Series have always been about the clashing ideals between two (or more) political factions who settle their differences between morally-grey blood bath.

&gt;At first, it might look like I'm talking about the same thing but when you dig slightly deeper, they're completely different. IBO is about personal wars, series with more conventional themes like SEED and 00 fought war for the greater good of humanity, for political reasons, not just for their own personal benefit. They only fought in wars to end other wars. In IBO, they fought in wars because that's how they live. Not for the greater good of others but for themselves.

Saying that Char was significantly better than Full Frontal.  


What I don't understand is that Full Frontal is basically saying he wants the spacenoids to have the power and be independent, leaving the federation to slowly die pretty much. What I understand from his speech is that there's no other way for humanity to evolve and get better and that ""possibility"" is something that earthnoids have swept under the rug forever so it's a waste of time to keep trying to give them a chance, they're bound to repeat history.   


That's pretty harsh, but I agree with him! He's saying earthnoids never learn and that in order for humanity to get to the next step, they should just be left alone and stripped from their powers. Like he said, it's better to create a future based on how reality works, instead of ""possibilities"".   


Now, why is the princess saying that Char was any different? That his passion was WAY better? Wasn't Char trying to kill people of Earth with an asteroid in CCA?

This manga had a lot of great and less than bad ideas, and one that infuriated me was the revelation of the Zeon Weapon of Revenge.It was revealed that kycilia research team found a virus that destroyed plants, and not only that it was conspired that the plan was to use it on colonies so humanity could restart UC.I not only found bollocks because it was out character for the zabis to do it, but also because its not a very UC thing (although i like the same used in Crossbones Ghost).

Well, my theory is, what if the real zeon weapon of revenge was actually the Unicorn ? Its curahzy because johnny ridden was made before unicorn, but hear me out, it has a lot of evidence.

First, it is stabilished that the federation by 0090 is infested with ex-Zeon soldiers in many positions that are kinda waiting for the right moment to backstab it.In Unicorn Banshe Desinee, a prequel to unicorn, it was revealed a secret agency within Federation that pulls the strings for the production of the Unicorn, it is very out of character for the Lazy Feds to do it,  this made me realize its actually Zeon Soldiers pushing  for a next neo zeon war to use that weapon or reveal laplaces box.

Second, kycilia already knew who would win the war and made the Chimera team protect under seven keys this weapon to use it in the right time.They didnt use it at that time because they were still searching how to make cybernewtypes, and then the symbol of the team is an Unicorn.It was stated that was a tech 10 years more advanced than the federation, which respect the time frame.

It would also explain a lot of plot holes, how Char was able to deliver this tech to the federation ? How Nanai got the psychoframe in the first place ?

I’ll be honest, I’ve only seen **’0080, War In The Pocket’** just a *few* times, awhile ago, and don’t remember much about it. (I‘ve heard the ending is depressing as Fuck, so I’ll definitely have to check back on it as soon as I can )

But between **’0083’** &amp; **’THE 8th MS TEAM’**, I have to give the *slight* edge to **’THE 8th MS TEAM’**, just because I found the story more engaging, and the characters a little more like able.

**’0083’** has great mecha designs in both the Zephyranthes, and the Dendrobium Stamen, and I like how it brought up the “Zero Barrier” term that NASA uses whenever an object is imminent with Earth. But I personally thought the characters were a little bland, and the overall story just sort of…plodded.
____________________________________________________________________

In **’THE 8th MS TEAM’**, is interesting watching Shiro’s rise from a nervous ensign to a commanding leader, and his &amp; Aina’s “forbidden” love keeps you hooked, just as to how they’re going to work around their ideological obstacles. And of course, the episode where Norris goes on the offensive with the Guntanks, so Aina can get to safety, you can’t beat that.

It's a lucky thing Alus was only able to hack into GBN. If he took the time to research the genesis and themes of Gundam, he'd realize that anti-war fueled the franchise's rise. How is this important?

Alus has a freaking mobile suit army and a satellite laser! If he had the brains to do it, he'd have realized that to break the BUiLD DIVERS, he'd have to break the world's faith in Gundam and Gunpla. How? By bringing the horrors of the OYW and Operation British to real-life Earth instead of using GBN as a proxy.

We were *this* close to having a full-scale mecha war erupt in a Gundam series where the Gundams are just fictional.

Imagine if Alus decided to take the route of coldly destroying faith in the Gundam brand and destroying the DIVERs link to Eldora by essentially bringing a real, horrible mecha war like the OYW with the atrocities that come with it annihilate GBN's popularity and get it closed, hence destroying Earth's link to Eldora.

If you take a Gundam from a series, and use it to replace the main Gundam from a different series, from the beginning of said series, how long until the Gundam you picked is outclassed? Assuming everything else remains the same 

For example, I’ve seen people make this argument about Gundam Barbatos. That it’s not considerably powerful compared to most other universes’ Mobile Suits, and would likely be outclassed by the end of The One Year War. 

Personally, I’d like the see how long the Wing Gundam would last through the UC timeline. It’s a more miniaturized suit like the later UC Crossbones/F91 suits, so that makes it quicker and harder to hit like said suits. It has significant firepower, even though it only has a few shots per engagement. I think the introduction of smaller Psycommu weapons on single mobile suits instead of larger mobile armors like the Elmeth and Zeong (not exactly a mobile armor but it’s funnel weapons aren’t like later versions on the Qubeley for example) would be where Wing falls. Wing Gundam’s Buster Rifle has too few shots, and is too impractical to hit small mobile funnel weapons. Granted, I haven’t watched all UC material yet, so please feel free to correct me if you think Wing would fall sooner than that.

Perhaps some unique property of the Minovsky particle causes the residual energy from the annihilation to form the Mega particle, making it possibly unrelated in behavior to regular Minovsky particles.
2. They call beams a ""plasma"", but for it to be a true plasma there'd have to be electrons flowing through it.

Now that I have viewed, and fallen in love, with *Zeta Gundam* (which I already discussed in a previous [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/i57ulr/just_finished_zeta_gundam_and_now_im_obsess_with/)), it felt natural that I continued on with some more Universal Century shows in the canon. Unfortunately due to the unavailability of *ZZ* on streaming, and the heavy price point of the Blu-Rays, I decided to skip that show for now and come back to it when it hopefully returns on the Gundam.Info YouTube page.

With that said, here are my thoughts on *Char’s Counterattack*, *0080: War in the Pocket*, and, in a later post, *the 08th MS Team*. Beware of spoilers if you haven’t seen any of these shows or movies.

**Char’s Counterattack** – This movie feels like the second half of an epic story, yet it was also the lesser half. I knew going in it was going to start in middle of the conflict, but man did the movie skip a lot to get to that point in the beginning of the movie. Char’s face turn feels is so jarring, especially considering how heroic he became in *Zeta*. While his motivations feel in-line with the character in his previous appearances, it is hard to reconcile that the noble Quattro Bajeena would become the cold-hearted Char again. We are really missing a middle step from Char’s fall from grace that the film didn’t feel the need to show or even explain in a satisfying matter: it just wanted to go straight to the conflict. It is especially hard to sympathize with Char when he wants to crash a giant meteor onto Earth, and he emotionally manipulates a young teen girl.

Speaking of young teen girl, I’m very confused with the movie’s choice to focus a good majority of its runtime with the new character Quess Paraya. The movie really puts in a lot of effort to make us care about Quess, and it’s just so confusing. The whole point of the film is to end the Amuro and Char rivalry, and ostensibly be the finale of the whole Universal Century story up to that point. Instead of centering on Amuro’s or Char’s character development, it wanted to focus on Quess and her multiple different suitors.

The lack of Sayla Mass also really bothered me, because 1) she was secretly the best character not nicknamed the Red Comet in the OG Gundam, and 2) it really doesn’t make much sense for her not to be involved with events of film considering her brother is the main driving force of the plot, and is even reusing their old family name to gain control over the Neo Zeon. I guess the film wanted to prioritize the masculine rivalry between Char and Amuro, and the wacky adventures of Quess more. (I know the common belief is that her voice actress stop being available after the OG, but it is still kind of ridiculous).

The fighting and overall direction is really solid throughout, with an almost neon glow emitting from the explosions being a very nice touch. There are also some very good character beats throughout the film, adding in a warmth to the story that was, at times, intentionally lacking in *Zeta*. Notable highlights include Chan Agi waiting for Amuro to finish changing outside his room in zero gravity, and Char getting handed a rose on a train. They’re small scenes, almost superficial, yet they add so much to the environment of the film. Even Quess’ and Hathaway’s early scenes together come off as being poignant, and it does make you care about their budding romance. That is until Quess turncoats, and Hathaway becomes a turd muncher and shoots Chan at the climax.

Ultimately, *Char’s Counterattack* is probably my least favorite Gundam thing I’ve watched so far. It isn’t bad, and definitely deserves a re-watched and re-analyzing, but it lacked the special sauce that really worked for me in the Gundam movie trilogy and *Zeta*.

**0080: War in the Pocket** – People say this is one of the best things Gundam-related period, and, yeah, I agree. Telling a simple tale between the friendship of a young boy and a Zeon soldier, War in the Pocket used its entire six-episode runtime very wisely. Nothing feels wasted, and you truly feel the bond between Alfred and Bernie. It’s sincere yet never sentimental, and it never spells out its anti-war message. There isn’t character spouting the evil of wars, nor is there any heavy-handed metaphor. You get the message through the characters’ actions, and the results of said actions.

The mini-series is really smart in how it portrays Alfred’s viewpoint on war, having him start off as a war-obsessed youth. Scenes like him casually destroying all the civilian buildings in his video game, and him being excited with school being canceled rather than care about the destruction that the Zeons caused really highlight a child’s mentality of war. Heck, I would have been excited for school being canceled as a kid. However, with his growing friendship with Bernie, the war starts hitting closer to home. The destruction feels more real now, shown through a scene where Alfred has a visible reaction in seeing a dead body in the wreckage. His changing state of mind is also nicely juxtapose with his friends continue indifference to the real damage that the war brings, which becomes more evident in final scene in the series.

While most of the early Gundam were about the consequences of war, in series like *Zeta* and the OG war was usually shown as a necessity. For example, if the AUEG don’t stop the Titans in *Zeta*, who would stop the Titan’s reign in space? However War in the Pocket really drives home the futility of war, especially among the average person. Whereas Amuro and Kamille were literally on the forefront in ending their respective wars, Bernie’s and Chris’ contribution to the One Year War were almost non-existent. Their little scuffle did not matter in the grand scheme of things. Bernie’s tragic fate also had an added ironic twist when it was realized that the Zeon ship carrying the nuke to destroy the colony was captured, making his sacrifice pointless. It really twists the knife in viewers’ hearts. Alfred’s friends’ reinsuring him that future wars will come is also a sad reflection to real world conflict and wars, serving as a metaphor on the circular nature of war. 

Even though *War in the Pocket* is most definitely a tragedy, there still a tenderness in the story that doesn’t make it feel like the sad-fest that was *Zeta*. Alfred genuine comes across as being a better person for getting to know Bernie, which is something that can’t be said about Kamille’s characters at the end of *Zeta*. The ending credits show Bernie holding up a Happy New Year sign with his classmates. Based on the events of the series, the ending credits are meant to take place after the climatic showdown between Bernie and Chris, suggesting that Bernie will eventually find his own way to move past it, giving hope that everything will turn out okay for him. At least that’s how I interpret it.

I’ll go over my feelings with *08th MS Team* in a later post, though my feelings on that show turned out to be a lot more complex than I would have thought.

Seriously. The RNG in this game is SADISTIC. It gave me two NT-1 beam rifles within 6 runs of a mission, which is damn good. But then when I'm looking to gain capacity +2 parts, I play the mission 6 times in a row, once a day for a week, and do not get anything.

It's been a decade since I watched most of the Gundam series. I initially watched most after playing DW:G3 and decided I should know more than what toonami showed me when I was a wee little lad. When I watched the whole series for the first time I fell even more in love with the franchise. Since then I've just built models and kept up with Unicorn and NT. 

I've decided to rewatch everything again and see if my tastes have changed or if it's as good as I remember. 

Since I've taken on this undertaking I've decided to watch every piece of Gundam media I can find and do a ranking video (not like my opinion really matters lol just a passion project).

I'm just about to finish ZZ gundam but I know there are some relevant game cutscene's to early UC that I should check out before I move on to CCA and 0096 and late UC. 

anywho

I have the battlefield record cutscenes thanks to the MSG trilogy, however I know I should look into Gihrens Greed, are there any other relevant game cutscenes, or special feature OVA type stuff I should check out? 

I also need to find Twilight Axis and green diver's if anyone know's the best way to do either of these. 

any help is appreciated!

What if Anavel Gato survived the events of 0083 and went on to participate in the 1st, 2nd, and/or 3rd Neo Zeon movements? (Neo Zeon because of his loyalty being OP)

What role(s) would he play? Who could he be defeated by? How would he react to the big secret of the Vist foundation?

Most importantly, what mobile suit(s) would he pilot?

To extend the conversation, please apply the same thoughts/questions to Cima Garahau. 🤩

I was thinking Gato'd be piloting a modified Rick Dias, Zaku III, and or a Dreissen/Rick Dom III.

Cima im at a complete loss for.

1. I don't do subs. Maybe that's heresy here, but I don't speak Japanese and can't get into it without English voice actors. Probably the only reason I still haven't watched ZZ :(
2. My first Gundam show was Gundam Wing, like many 90s kids.
3. I've seen I think the entire UC timeline (minus ZZ). OG, Zeta, 08th MS Team, 0080, 0083, Unicorn.
4. I liked Seed, not so much Seed Destiny.
5. 00 Gundam Season 1 is probably one of my all time favorite Gundam shows, if only because I love &gt;!how the point was for the Gundams to loose. For the first time, ""fighting for peace"" actually made sense, the Gundams were to become such a huge threat that it forced the world to finally unify to stop them. Brilliant.!&lt;
   1. I then pretend that everything 00 after Season 1 does not exist...

A while back I watched both seasons of 00 and honestly, I didn't really enjoy it.  Certainly I'm missing something.  If I am, can anyone please fill in the gaps?

So, as I understand, the show is about an escalating arms race being shut down by a collective of vigilantes who wish to end war and aid in the evolution of man.  My problem is, Celestial Being is so much stronger than everyone they don't seem to be as much a symbol of peace as aggressive enforcers of it.  Like, completely logical wars, such as in Sri Lanka where the conflict between the state and the Tamil is shockingly complex and has a case to be made that it's justified, are shut down without any reason for either side to attempt to seek peace other than coercion.

Also, Setsuna is an enigma.  I assume he's meant to represent a Muslim judging by the heavy use of swords and the number seven surrounding him.  I think he wants to end war himself, but is sinking into a reliance on it, hence his desire to ""become Gundam"".  His motivations, and really everyone's in Celestial Being's for that matter, seems blurry.  I suppose he wants to see peace in the Middle East, but only if ""his side"" is put in charge?  He doesn't act in the first season with any clear motives when in Azadistan (I assume it's named after the very shortly lived state in 1920 that is now part of Iran).  The show also super downplays the complexity of the conflicts in the Middle East, and most in general.

The show also seems to be more focused on battles than it does on saying something.  The original Gundam series took imagery from both world wars and many of Japan's imperialistic ventures and criticized how we look at things like war, race, nationality, ideology, evolution and the value of life.  00 doesn't seem to cover much other than a criticism of war.  The second season only made things less clear, since now Celestial Being was undoing what they worked towards in the first season.

And the final battle just is so weird.  The army of clones(?) was just out of no where.  It's flashy, I'll give it that, but it doesn't feel at any time like any of Celestial Being are even close to being in danger.

Does any of this get explained in the movie?

Through out the series Athrun and Kira were pulling punches on each other because 1 either they dont want to seriously hurt each other and 2 they are just kids fighting someone elses war. They dont know what their allegiances lie besides the uniform they wear. They dont know the meaning of what theyre fighting for at this point and its clear Kira doesnt know what the fuck hes even doing there besides making sure his friends are safe.

Athrun is out for revenge for his teammate Nicols death which Kira accidentally killed him because he was trying to defend himself, this gets Athrun out for Kiras blood and in their encounter next Tolle gets dragged into it. He dies as a result there fore getting Kira out for Athruns blood and the boiling point of these 2 characters goes at a all time high to eliminate each other. Which for the first time in the show we really see how 2 people can be dragged into a death match against each other which to some point you can relate to them.

I think I remember reading somewhere that the writers behind Re:Rise wanted to create a completely original gundam series, but were forced into a build series, which is why it feels so different from the rest. But I could totally be making a mistake and taking someone's theory as fact. Does anyone know for sure or have a link to an article that details it?

I feel like it's pretty clear that the writers wanted to tell a different story simply due to how little gunpla as a whole actually matters in the story. You could switch out ""gunpla"" with ""gundam"" and nearly have the same major story beats, minus a couple of beats like &gt;!the characters thinking it was a video game at the start!&lt;. I also feel like it has a darker tone than the other build series I've watched (OG, Try, and the first few episodes of Divers), which is kind of interesting because I wonder how different the story would've been had it been its own series or even just how dark things would've actually gotten.

For all we know, Stargazer was an MS body that housed the equivalent of a machine learning algo, for the purposes of deep space exploration using what is basically a solar sail.

Armament wise, it's not exactly a strong piece of equipment. At best you're looking at beam rifles and fancy CQC nonsense that requires specific training to utilize, and isn't easily transferable to someone who was piloting a Dagger with a beam saber. Couple this with how it's a one off prototype, and you've got maintenance logistics issues when it inevitably takes a hit. 

In terms of it's power plant; sure it can run on a nuke, but that's hardly been an issue with how the methodology of the earth alliance fights.

Which series is the least bad to women? Its been a while since I've seen most of these, so I hope I am not over simplifying:

OG: Sayla, Mirai and Fraw end up relegated to advancing Char, Amuro and Brights plots. Mirai ""gets"" to be married and be a mother despite being an amazing pilot. 

Zeta: Fa even becoming a pilot is still told to look after the children? Four gets fridged, Sarah and Reccoa end up obsessed with Scirocco. There are countless other women that die or give their lives up for the men. We Get Haman...but

ZZ: One of the worst.  Haman goes from supervillian to pedo. Puru I and II are obsessed with either killing Judau or being surrogate little sister. Chara i guess has her own plot? Roux ends up as just as part of the love (counts: square, pentagon?) with Haman, Elle and Glemy? I forgot Elle even existed.

CCA: Chan gets fridged. Quess only wants Char. 

Unicorn: Ple 12, mostly decent? Overly tragic backstory. At least she isnt spending all day chasing Banagher as a love interest. Mineva doesn't get to do a ton.

0080: Yay Chris! She is a competent pilot and compassionate person. I dont think anything wrong here? 

0083: FFS. Nina is terrible. Mora literally is just there to punch guys and then fall in love with Keith.

Wing: Releena is just Mineva Zabi. My girl Noin is the best, but her plot is to make Zechs look better.

Seed: Nothing good here, right? 

00: Sumeragi is cool. She gets her own arc? I dont remember too much but I think she is fine and doesn't need boys saving her all the time. 

I know its very reduced and I expect to see a lot of down votes. But, I'm serious.

* **MSG** \- decent, really shouldn’t be this action-oriented/super-roboty, show is too dark for that
* **MSGZ** \- good, adult theme, fitting for this heavy and depressing anime 
* **MSGZZ** – bad! lazy and uninspired, too much like Zeta
* **0080** – bad! always skipped, theres nothing to watch
* **F91** – decent, at best (this op is unused in the end)
* **0083** \- great! aged really well, good combo of songs and animation
* **Victory** – mediocre, not bad and not decent
* **G** – good, personally haven’t watched but these songs and the animation are quite good and fitting for its super robotness
* **Wing** – good, well-made combination of good song and animation
* **8MST** – great! it has everything that makes an intro fantastic
* **X** – mediocre (1st) and good (2nd), 1st op prolly most boring of all Gundam and op 2 is nice
* **Turn A** – good, definitely the weirdest op of the bunch, but still good and unique
* **Seed/Destiny** – great! ushered in a new era of amazing Gundam ops
* **00 (+movie)** – great! following seed’s example, these are among the best openings in all of Gundam
* **AGE** – good or great, kind of inbetween, definitely good but not at the level of great
* **GBF/T** – good, markedly happier than the rest of Gundam which fits its show well
* **G-Reco** – decent 1st op, beautiful song wasted with terrible editing and a mediocre 2nd op
* **UC:0096** – great! that ep 18 special op was something else entirely
* **IBO** – great! the hype really elevates these ops to the next level
* **Origin** – good, the songs are chosen well and that short 0079 reanimation was lit
* **Divers** – mediocre and decent, tried to copy GBF a bit too much, 1st op still hurts my ears
* **RR** – good, feels better than GBD, but not as innovative as GBF, the 2nd season’s tonal shift was executed well

**Full review:**

* **MSG** \- Its really not that good nor has it aged well but to their credit, for the budget and time constraints they had it was pretty decent. It failed to give the viewer a real grasp of what the show is about and marketed itself as a super robot, where the show and staff were really trying to make this as a realistic, heavy, and grounded war story.
* **MSGZ** \- They intentionally strayed away from the more action heavy intro despite being a mecha anime which was really different for the time where it really sells that this is not your super robot anime, something the original MSG was trying to achieve but wasn’t able to evade it on the intro. Visually, for both ops, yes it is less interesting and many reused clips but there is a message, a story if you will, it carries and prepares you for the darkness that is Zeta.
* **MSGZZ** \- This is probably the laziest and most ""kid-friendly"" (mileage may vary) of the UC intros, being relegated mostly as meme status, especially the Anime Ja Nai, quite bad as far Gundam intros go. You don’t get the same weight as the Zeta intros and overall, despite being more kid-friendly, doesn’t really show any good animation at all that might want you to watch. The op 2 is definitely better than op 1 but still mediocre at best. Lastly, they showed Char in the op but not the show, definitely -1000 points from that stunt alone (lol).
* **0080** – I don’t recall a time when I didn’t skip this intro except for my first viewing and frankly, it is very fitting for the show itself, but it was just a bit too much of nothing. This is like what I said about Zeta but turned it up to 11 where it’s all just a scrolling of symbolism (maybe?). The song is, and I hesitate to say this, mediocre.
* **F91** – Yes, im surprised myself to find it has an opening, but it is unused due to how the show became a movie. Overall, I think its just decent at best.
* **0083** – These were good. I swear these are really good and are the first Gundam ops to have aged well (and probably the ones that have aged the best so far). The songs were bombastic and the animation is crisp and among the very best that time (even better than the later Victory). Also, these revel in what was already established in Gundam adding to the history and depth on top of the songs and action. 
* **Victory** – Mediocre because its nothing groundbreaking nor innovative. The songs are lackluster and its only the animation that carries the day, but also lacks any story, meaning, or depth.
* **G** – Good, personally haven’t watched but those songs and the animation are quite good and fitting for its super robotness. Can’t say much about the only Gundam show I haven’t watched (and prolly will never).
* **Wing** – No doubt the songs and their animation are definitely good. The 1st op is more mecha oriented and the 2nd op is more character oriented, both are good in their own right. However, it’s quite criminal for them though to only use the second op in less than 10 eps. 
* 8MST – This is probably the best opening in all of UC, and for good reason. The song is a banger, the animation is so well done, and it has the best balance of characters and mechas, just like the show itself. More importantly, even with all the action, it is driven by a story with some of the best depth seen in any Gundam opening.
* **X** – 1st op was terribly boring (song and animation) and just showcases Gundam X going thru some stock animation. 2nd op, however, has got the hallmarks of a good opening and has it all, just missing that little bit of effort to make it truly great.
* **Turn A** – Definitely the weirdest of all the Gundam ops. I’m not sure how it should be properly rated, but it is mostly character/plot driven and the bits of animation and the good use of cgi that are there are crisp. Moreover, the editing is done well, especially on the 1st op. At worst tho, the 2nd op is just decent. For me it will be good, all things considered.
* **Seed &amp; Destiny** – This series has the craziest number of ops in Gundam, and most of these songs were sung by among the best singers and bands at the time. Many of the songs are quite great even on their own and are real good bangers while the animation, although some are reused (which really represents the show itself), have a distinct style and are well made while still showing a lot of story and symbolism of the show on top of looking stunning. These are probably the best intros of the early 2000s which really goes to show that these are among the best ops of the whole of Gundam and really paved the way for future Gundam shows to make an effort into their music. The first openings of both Seed and Destiny in particular were the best of the show.
* **00 (+movie)** – Following Seed’s example of well-crafted openings, these are hands down some of the best openings in Gundam. It’s got it all: banger songs, beautiful animation, spoils nothing, all the characters, Gundams fighting, amazing shots &amp; scenes, tells a good story by itself while adding to the backstory of the show overall, and they add to the growing mystery unfolding within the series. As a bonus, there’s A LOT of symbolism than the animation lets on, like the butterfly in the 4th op can symbolize a multitude of things. Another added bonus is the Movie’s op which serves two functions: instead of focusing on the characters and the Gundams, are all about the ELS which first come off as abstract art but makes sense later knowing the background of the ELS. Speaking of the characters, it also visually shows what has happened to the crew
* **AGE** – I got to say, despite being a lackluster show (except for Asemu and 3Gen arcs, those were great and good, respectively), these opening (and the endings too!) are quite well made! They may not be as much of a banger as previous openings, but the musical and visual impacts are all there. The songs are good as well as the animation as it is consistently crisp and thus feels natural. Overall, they’re definitely good.
* **GBF/T** – This show and its op was full of passion and delight and a celebration of Gundam, to the point where it literally calls back to seed-style character+mech cards in opening, which was a nice touch. The ops here really take the best parts of seed and 00 and pretty much have everything that made those great and adapting it into this more fun style fitted for a show like build fighters. However, I don’t know what’s missing but there’s just something lacking for me to elevate it into great rather than just good.
* **G-Reco** – It pains me to see that the 1st song here was good and the visuals were no doubt good, but the visual language is confusing and have no depth at all. The editing is kinda hit-and-miss, missing more than hitting the mark, and most of the footage here is literally just cut from the anime. The 2nd ops song is also terrible. All in all, it’s a lazily made intro from a confusing mess of a show, no doubt a failure. The ending song should’ve been used for the 2nd op instead.
* **UC:0096** – Really struggling here to rank this either as good or great. I’m leaning more towards just good because there is no story nor depth here, except for a showcase of the journey from the start til the end paralleling and complementing unicorn really well. The visuals, although mostly reused (except for the Sinanju flaunting its Beam Axes), are visually pleasing and has some of the best edits in Gundam intros so far. That special opening in episode 18 tho SOUNDS. AND. LOOKS. SO. BEAUTIFULLY. The song is perfect and the visuals are stunning and innovative. Really love the direction this one went and should be praised. Overall, the 1st was good, the 2nd is definitely great!
* **IBO** – Describing IBO ops in one word: HYPE! Again, same as 00, this has everything and more. Banger songs, story portrayal, well timed editing, unending symbolism, and maximum visual impact, its all there. What really set these apart is the massive hype that they were able to make which was quite unreal. The show was expected by everyone to be another G-reco but that opening, Raise Your Flag (1st op), elevated the show to the highest level and is really in a league of its own. The style chosen here was uniquely innovative and consistent all throughout. The music on IBO was definitely curated with love and passion.
* **Origin** – Quite surprised to see this has an op at all. They’re definitely in the same vein as the 0096 op and the songs fit really well for Origin. The editing and visuals are phenomenal, definitely inspired by 0096s Ep 18 special intro and that short reanimated scene of 0079 was unique and a fresh take on doing openings as a whole in anime, quite awe-inspiring. Overall, these were good and leaning heavily on being great.
* **Divers** – Christ that first opening hurts my ears. The animation was good and clearly inspired by Build Fighters/Try but the song just hurts, it doesn’t sound good but to their credit the editing was done really well to fit the song. Moreover, -1000 points for that Gundam Frame tease which was disappointingly just a Galbaldy. The second op definitely better than the first but still lacking. Could’ve been better, 1st op was mediocre, 2nd was decent.

Since he wanted to see the series past the One Year War, I recommended that he watch 0083: Stardust Memory. Below is the transcript of a Q&amp;A session I did with him to get his opinion on the series.

**First off, what did you think of the protagonists, Kou Uraki and Nina Purpleton, and their romance?**

Kou comes off as honestly a bit generic, not so much lacking in character, just that his character is not to act according to character save a few outburst. Nina seems like should have been more interesting, but the writers just didn't want her to have a role outside being Kou and Gato's trophy prize to fight over.

**What did you think of the Zeon remnants, such as Delaz, Gato, and Cima?**

Delaz and Gato were naturally men of conviction. They were devoted to a cause, even if it was a shitty and twisted one that needed even shittier and twisted means to achieve it, but you could see them applying that passion to any other cause in a different world. Cima is a genuinely interesting character, and I'm annoyed they decided to off her. I feel she could have been a very good player in later series. Always a character who you don't know which side she'll be on for any given show. Instead they just killed her, cause apparently telling your soldiers who they need to be fighting is too smart for this depiction of the Earth Federation commanders.

**What did you think of Operation Stardust?**

The desired outcome was an interesting idea, but there simply were way too many cogs needed to make it work; and even the last phase could have been completely undone by the Fed scientist bothering to take the extra step to figure out where the colony would go after breaking orbit. So in the end it was honestly a stupid plan that only worked cause plot demanded it.

**Speaking of the Federation, what did you think of them in this series?**

You had two officers who actually belonged in their position, literally everyone else reeked of incompetence. Operation Stardust basically relied on Federation command being absolutely retarded and incompetent, and thankfully for them, Federation command was absolutely retarded and incompetent. No safety measures, no forward thinking, no proactive action.

**Were there any mobile suits or mobile armors that you liked?**

The purple ones with the head crest, (the Gelgoog Marine/Gelgoog Marine Commander Type) were cool to see beyond the single time they showed up in Gundam. Other then that is was mostly just reshowings of the ones we'd seen before. Though the upgraded GM/Guncannon showed potential.

**Where do you think the Universal Century timeline is going to go from here?**

One of my favorite parts of Re:Rise is Hiroto’s well written backstory/character arc, it showing that not everyone got the happy ending they wanted out of Riku’s little revolution. It put everything that happened last season into a completely different light, and tbh made the previously mentioned paper thin writing slightly more bearable. Though the next episode has me slightly worried, with the BUILD DiVERS facing off against the BUILD DIVERS. Hiroto is going head to head with Riku directly and they’re probably gonna exchange words. While I trust the writers on this show, I can’t help but feel like Riku’s gonna give some spiel on the power of friendship and everything’s gonna be all right between him and Hiroto. I’d much rather Hiroto say something to the effect of “I don’t hate you, but I sure as heck don’t like you...” and that’d be the way it stayed at the moment, let Riku understand what he did wasn’t good for everyone and that his actions have consequences, maybe even a chance for the cardboard cutout to grow something of a character.

Here's some other way you could fix Destiny:

&gt;It’s a few hours after the failed Orb invasion. Djibril escaped and Requiem has already fired its first shot at PLANT. All of the Minerva characters are gathered in the hangar of the ship. Lunamaria is acting especially panicky. They’re all looking at a strange object: A banged up Infinite Justice, lying in a heap with scratch marks following it all the way from the hangar doors. It was crash-landed by an inexperienced pilot.  
&gt;  
&gt;The medics get the cockpit open and lift out the pilot. It’s an unconscious Meyrin.  
&gt;  
&gt;Okay, now back up about 20 minutes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Archangel crew is gathered on their bridge. Meyrin is there with them. They’re in shock as they watch the burning remains of PLANT on their screen. Requiem just finished firing.  
&gt;  
&gt;“My God,” Meyrin says. “You-… you did this! You killed everyone!” She turns her head accusingly toward the entire plucky team of Kira, Athrun, Lacus, Murrue, and Mwu. “And I helped you!” She starts to nervously back away, eyes wide with terror and with her hands covering her mouth.  
&gt;  
&gt;Athrun tries to counsel her. He’s like “No, no, no. There’s nothing we could have done. We were just trying to protect Orb.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Meyrin is having none of it. She’s like “Don’t lie to me like that! All you did was push ZAFT back. They could have caught Djibril and prevented this from happening if you had just listened to them!”  
&gt;  
&gt;Athrun is like “But Meyrin, Durandal is the real enemy here. He only invaded because he wanted to destroy Orb.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Meyrin is like “All you think about is Orb! How can you stand there telling me you still know what’s right and wrong when you let THIS happen?” She nervously points at the smolder space colonies and hundreds of thousands dead on the screen with her shaking forefinger. She’s probably one of the ZAFT personnel who lost family in the attack.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meyrin storms out of the bridge and presumably goes back to her room to let everything pour out. Athrun tries to chase her. Kira holds his shoulder in a friendly way and says “She’ll be okay. She just needs to sort things out for herself.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Athrun reluctantly agrees. The Archangel characters settle down and start talking about what they need to do next. They do their whole spiel from the show about how Durandal wants to be the high priest of mankind, etc. etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;Just before the part where Kira high-fives Athrun and tells him “Let’s go to space to get the Chairman,” the emergency alarm starts going crazy on the bridge. Something big is happening in the mobile suit bay. Someone got inside Athrun’s Gundam and they’re recklessly forcing themselves off of the ship.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s Meyrin.  
&gt;  
&gt;She’s already outside and flying away when the Archangel guys get to the hangar. She obviously sucks as a pilot, but she has a basic enough understand of mobile suit controls to fly in a sort-of straight line toward the Minerva’s coordinates. Kira flies out after her in Strike Freedom. Athrun borrows a Murasame, the Akatsuki, or one of the DOMs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Athrun catches up and tells her to calm down, she doesn’t know what she’s doing.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meyrin gets on the radio like “I know exactly what I’m doing! I’m taking this invincible super-Gundam out of your hands before you help murder anyone else with it! Even if ZAFT executes me as a traitor at this point, at least less people will have to die!”  
&gt;  
&gt;Kira tries to fly in front of her to do a non-lethal takedown, but Meyrin’s janky-ass movements end up being her advantage. Kira doesn’t know where to aim because her piloting is just so goddamn goofy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Athrun keeps trying to talk her down. Kira swoops in again, but Meyrin presses the button that detaches the IJ’s backpack from the rest of its body. I think. Can the IJ still fly on Earth without its lifter? Seriously, I dunno.  
&gt;  
&gt;The backpack awkwardly clonks into Strike Freedom with enough force to temporarily disable it (assuming IJ can still fly without it). A frantic, grief-stricken Lacus gets on Athrun’s channel. Meyrin is going nuts. Athrun’s the only one skilled enough to stop her, before the Archangel/Orb/Terminal loses like 50% of its most important arsenal and Durandal gets one of the two most powerful Gundams ever built on a silver platter.  
&gt;  
&gt;Athrun is pleading with Meyrin to come back. He lines up a shot at the IJ’s fuselage. “Damn it, Meyrin! Don’t make me do this!”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Then go ahead and do it, you hypocrite!” Meyrin suddenly screams in rage, tears streaming down her eyes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then she’s like “After saying all that stuff you said about how Durandal is trying to destroy the world and Shinn is just a tool, are you going to do the same thing when you’re in his position? Are you, Athrun?” Athrun is absolutely CRUSHED by this.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meyrin flies further away. Kira comes back but he gets caught up in an ethical argument with Athrun. Meyrin fades off in the distance, inching closer and closer to the Minerva as it withdraws from Orb.

This is one of my first posts on this Reddit but I really wanted to share my thoughts and discuss after watching an unreasonable amount of gundam in such a short time. It’s a bit long so if you’re not here for that no worries. 

Reminder: these are my thoughts and perspectives but I’m looking forward to hearing others so let’s all try to be nice and understanding. I adore Gundams and have enjoyed it for over 20 years so I’m quite passionate about this fascinating series. Also I watch mostly dubs because i have a hard time focusing on the visuals and voices while reading the subs. And did I mention this post is long?

So I’ll start with some brief thoughts on all the ones I watched for the first time or rewatched.

Mobile suit gundam, rewatch: This held up so much better than I expected. The characters and plot points were coherent and compelling. It did feel very soap opera like with all the drama. Not a deal breaker but could be better. Animation and voice acting was good. Char is always a delight. Also I wasn’t pleased with the amount of toxic interpersonal interactions between characters. I was also disappointed at the lack of nuance in the politics and ideals compared to other series.

Zeta Gundam, first watch: this was pretty decent. Char was the best part of this show and hyaku Shiki is such a cool suit. Also I’ve never wanted to punch Amuro more.  The politics and ideals of peace and war were much better. I didn’t like as many characters this time but they weren’t awful. Also I wish they’d stop hitting each other to solve their disagreements.

Char’s counterattack, rewatch: man was this bad. Incoherent and so many new characters with no development. I was also disappointed in Char’s character regression. I could see the points they were getting across as to why but it didn’t work for me. Nu gundam is awesome though 

War in the pocket, rewatch: this was so good. I honestly have almost no complaints. Short, beautiful and poignant. Also gets high praise for having an awesome lady be the gundam pilot.

G Gundam, rewatch: I love the suit designs in this one. They’re just a joy to see. Characters not so much. Rain was by far the most interesting character and gets to pilot a gundam, along with Alenby. Honestly this felt like gundam in style of dragonball. Overly dramatic and repetitive. I actually couldn’t finish the rewatch, I was so bored by the time the Hong Kong tournament was finishing I couldn’t continue.

Gundam Wing, rewatch: used to be my favorite. Gundam designs were great. The commentary on war and peace was well done and most of the characters were fantastic. I wanted to punch wu fei and his toxic masculinity the whole series and he just never stopped. Good villains and character arcs. I really appreciated Heero’s shift on how he valued his own life.

08th MS Team, first watch: wow was this also great. Definitely captured the feel of Gundam but in the Vietnam war. Good characters and payoffs. Commentary on war and peace was great. My one complaint was the blatant sexualizing of Kiki who’s underage. No matter what time period this released in that’s not ok. Other than that, loved this series.

Gundam Seed, first watch: I enjoyed this a lot. Great gundam designs and characters overall. The commentary on racism and revenge was quite good. Has one of my favorite scenes in the whole series when Cagalli is talking to athrun about revenge. Not many complaints here. Also Cagalli is awesome and one of my favorite gundam characters.

Seed Destiny OVAs, first watch: I decided to watch the OVAs since it focused more on Athrun and less on the new characters and the amount of drama between them in the series. It very much felt like “you liked gundam seed? Here’s some more!” Which I didn’t mind. I thought it was reasonable and I enjoyed seeing more character development and cool suits.

Gundam 00, first watch and then rewatch: I like it so much I had to show it to my partner about a month later. This show is so tightly designed and made it’s beautiful. The political commentary, great characters, memorable suit designs and spectacular plot are all so well done and meticulously made. I could go for hours about what I like about this one. Blows all the others out of the water. Also by far has the most nuanced protagonist. Setsuna is just such a good boy.

Gundam Unicorn, rewatch: so I thought this was ok. The suit designs and animation were neat. Mineva was the most interesting character. I decided at this point I’m not as into universal century stories. They just don’t work for me. A lot of the characters were uninteresting. The commentary and plot payoffs were weak. Full frontal is just not a compelling bad guy.

Gundam age, first watch: I’m so disappointed in this show. Started with interesting conceits and characters. The third arc around Kio on Mars was amazing. I was so hopeful. And then the last arc just devolved into the characters becoming more and more unreasonable and everyone egging each other on into more death and chaos with poor Kio in the middle trying his best. I couldn’t finish it after fram died as the ninth named woman to die for men’s lives or character growth.

Iron-blooded orphans, first watch: this series was an emotional rollercoaster. The heavy commentary on classism was quite good. The characters were really interesting, the battles were intense, and the plot was well done. My biggest complaint is the way it killed a lot of the characters. I don’t like it when characters are killed mostly for shock value. In 00 characters deaths have weight. Not every death has to mean something, but enough people die for no reason in real life that I don’t care for it in my media.

Thunderbolt, first watch: this one was weird. There wasn’t much story other than what was established in UC but the concepts were interesting. Also the animation and soundtrack were amazing.

Overall series thoughts

Politics and war: My major props for gundam as a whole is how frequently they tackle major societal issues we actually face in real life. Sci fi is always a great medium for exploring real concepts in more easily palatable mediums. Best example for me of that is deep space nine. They’re almost always presented in easily digestible forms without sacrificing the nuance and significance of the subject. Above all, the goal of peace is an ever present factor in most of the stories. That the show revolves around wars with giant robots with that being the end state shows the complexity of the stories they try to tell in almost every series.

Gender: So full disclosure, I’m a girl and my experiences in life greatly affect my views. I have strong feelings on how women are treated in media because whether we like it or not fantasy reflects reality and human society as a whole has a long and still present history of treating women as lesser people. Gundam as a whole seems to treat women with significance and respect. However they’re usually subtly treated as less valuable than men and shown to be easily manipulated because of our feelings. Unlike the political and social commentary, issues around gender are almost never addressed. If you look at most of them, there are so many women killed for men or killed because their emotions get the better of them. We don’t exist solely to support men or help them grow stronger and our strong emotions and how we live with them aren’t a weakness. But that’s certainly how we’re treated in many gundam shows and in a lot of media in general. The issues aren’t only for women either. The ideal of being a great strong man is so revered in this series. This is probably one of the most toxic parts of gundam. The pressure for guys to be “real men” is completely unrealistic and dangerous. Also I’m really pissed that not a single one of the main gundam pilots in AGE was a girl. I mean come on it wouldn’t have been hard. It’s really irritating to feel like a series I love doesn’t value women as much as other genders. There is no good reason besides prejudice that there haven’t been more women as main gundam pilots to headline a series. And the argument that a series won’t sell as well with a female lead is preposterous because plenty of other forms of media have had female protagonists and been wildly popular. Plus, not doing it because “shows with female leads don’t sell well” is a self fulfilling prophecy and is part of the problem.

Military: Gundams approach to representing the military is one of things it’s best at creating commentary on. To me it can be distilled down to the idea the soldiers should be protectors first and foremost and emphasizing the importance of following orders. However in almost every show they also show how a soldier still needs to be able to think for themselves and how devastating the effects of blindly following orders can be.

Mobile suits: gosh Gundams are cool. There’s so much creativity and love in their design and animation I can’t get enough of it. I have found that I prefer the series with multiple gundam pilots as they tend to have more creativity in the designs overall.

Favorites!!!

Characters: Soma and Setsuna are by far my favorite characters. They’re both extremely well written and have great character arcs.

Mobile suit: Gundam 00 and its variants are my favorite. I love their designs and their pilot. But most of all, the 00’s true power is not in strength, but in the ability to help sentient beings communicate and understand each other on an intimate level to promote peaceful coexistence. That in itself makes it, to me, the best gundam. Because if there one thing gundam series want more than anything is peace and this is the gundam most able to accomplish that in a productive and healthy way.

Favorite villain: Char is just the best. His voice, style and goals are almost always enjoyable. He’s also just so pretty ☺️ His portrayal in Counterattack was also probably a reason why I dislike it so much. The development he gets in zeta was so good and then it just got wiped away. Maybe since I didn’t watch ZZ I missed something but I haven’t heard much good about the series.

There's also Gundam Universe, but from what I've heard they don't pose too well &amp; don't look great up close. I don't know if HG, RG, or MG is best for me, which is why I'd rather ask professionals here who know what would fit my style.

My first and only kit was a Gundam Exia, years ago for my birthday. I followed the instructions and everything, but when I finished it the head was messed up, and the next day it fell apart.

He's finally back to give the Zeons hell!
His beam rifle gun can fire in spurts
If he shoots ya, it's gonna hurt!

He can teleport, communicate to suit his mood
He’s quick and nimble when he needs to be
He can move at lightning speeds through galaxies!

Celestial being is too overpowered strong!

This OP Gundam just digs this tune!

And this time he's in the feral mood

With his beast claws out, he's one tough suit!

And Gjallarhorn beware 'cause its after you!

Finally, it’s here for you
It's the last member of the Gundam crew!
This Gundam’s so strong, it isn't funny
Can make a Zeon suit cry out for its mummy
Can take over funnels with relative ease
Makes disabling armies seem such a breeze
The beast of possibility, hope never dies
But this Gundam’s one hell of a guy!

While I, of course, enjoyed the films, my real aim was always to watch Zeta. It's pedigree as one of the best Gundams and its overall dark style drew me in even before I even got to watch it. When I finally finished watching it, I couldn't stop thinking about it. 

Zeta is very much a show about pathos, with all the characters reacting more emotionally rather than logically. It is show passionate in what it is trying to say, and all the emotional highs just hit me in the right spots. It does help that I feel like a lot of the themes and message are starting to feel more like a potential reality. Even though I'm in the honeymoon phase of my love of Zeta, I very much recognize its issues and I don't fault anyone who can't look past those problems (Personally, the biggest issue narrative is that Rosammy's character and Reccoa's heel turn are not good portrayals of women in media). However I do think it is a show that is worth watching at least once, and any short comings are overshadowed by how much it does right.

The ending (which I knew about going in) has completely devastated me, and now I feel like I need a palate cleanser. But at the same time I want more of it still, and I am having trouble finding any decent fan created stuff for Zeta. I want to see more fan art, fan posters, theories, written pieces, all of it (except maybe videos, for whatever reason I don't like a lot anime-critique on YouTube). I'm literally listening to all three versions of Mizu no Hoshi e Ai wo Komete all day, for several days on repeat.

Obviously, like I said, I'm very much in the honeymoon phase, and it will eventually pass.

The camera dramatically turns around, and we see it's... Ali piloting the exact same trivial crap they already destroyed. Ooooh. I'm really feeling menaced by this shocking turn of events.

For some reason, it finally dawned on me to wonder just WHEN (in-universe) Char realized he could use White Base and Gundam for his revenge on the Zabis.

Up until White Base attempted re-entry after leaving Luna II, Char was characterized as just an elite, loyal Zeon commander, frustrated by the Gundam's success in battle. During the battle in ""Re-Entry to Earth"", Char seems to be really bothered by the loss of Kohm and Crown. There's a bit of exposition from Dren where he tells Char 'hey, you did great. The Trojan Horse will now re-enter Earth in Garma Zabi's region, what a great plan.' Char takes credit and then radios Garma to explain what's happened.

There were a couple of things Char didn't know at the beginning of the sortie. 

* He didn't know that White Base would send out a mobile suit that deep into the Earth's gravity well.
* He didn't know that Gundam could re-enter the atmosphere on its own.
* He didn't know he would end up losing both Crown and Kohm.

After he joins Garma's unit, there are a sprinkling of scenes where Char's hatred of Garma becomes clear and you see him convincing Garma to launch horribly stupid schemes and even sabotaging equipment. And then Garma get's New Yarked.

So here is my question - did Char really orchestrate the outcome of the battle to divert White Base and Gundam into Garma's region so that he could use them to kill the Zabi Heir? Or was it all dumb luck and he took credit when Dren praised Char for his 'plan'?

Some viewers in gundam cant quite agree on one thing: the order to watch gundam.Some say it is best by the production order, or by the order which each gundam was made in real life, and others says it is best to watch in the year order  each show presents itself in.Today i will argue why i think it is best to watch in Chronological order, and for that i need to analise the two most controversial points: 1)Watching Stardust Memory before Zeta and 2) Watching Unicorn before Late Universal Century.

From the first second of watching Mobile Suit Gundam Zeta, we learn that federation's faction Titans are a corrupted abusive group, there is no mystery to it nor explanation to how things got like this.Although figuring it yourself is a good experience, i would say its a far more interesting experience to watch zeta after the hooks stardust memory left us, like hey i remember this weird Jamitov, he was one of the culprits of the operation stardust, was this what he planned to do all along ? Consider this, stardust memory starts off right at the end of 0079 and serves the purpose of sending the final goodbye to the original Zeon, while setting up the next threat, it would be like watching Infinity War without watching Civil War.One could argue that it serves as a bridge from Z and ZZ in terms of tone if you watch in the production order, but i would counter argue that there are things better to the job that wont compromise your imersion, like reading Char Delleted Affair.

If i didnt sell you on the first one, i am sure that i will get you in the second one, because i have strong arguments to defend you should watch Unicorn BEFORE watching Victory or F91.In the final ova epsode of Unicorn, it is revealed that newtypes have rights to rule the earth and colonies, its an interesting take on the newtype subject and represents the power of possibility to make mankind grow up, but if you have watched F91 or Victory before Unicorn, it kinda ruins the experience, because you already knows that humanity continues to stagnate and the concept of newtype is forgotten.

In conclusion, many gundam series were made between other sagas, but these not only fit in the chronological order, they also fit there plot wise, thematic wise and character wise.UC gundam is just a collection of stories that have their take on the messages of evolution and critique of war, and it would be wise to watch them in chronological order, not only to have a better imersion, but because each piece of story tells a take on the messages of the show that would be better understood if the viewer watched them following the events of the show, in other words, should be watched in the Chronological Order.

It's very close but the snout I was going for more of the gouf flight type style in case I could fit the zaku III custom type beam weapon in there. The gun...I think is spot on but no idea what that big barrel thing is.  The blue I feel could have been lighter and more bright Azure, the white could definitely be brighter like cloudy/pearl white along with a more vibrant red. The hoses were supposed to be white and I feel the lower feet could have been possible white and not the gray.

&amp;#x200B;

The claws I wasn't really trying to go for a fixed look but more deployable by flipping forward. The shield I really wanted to be as long as a Zulu guards type shield and a bit wider.

&amp;#x200B;

The skirts were supposed to have a bit more style look of the thunderbolt version where it looks like more thrusters/exhaust

&amp;#x200B;

The shoulders look fine but maybe could have been a little more gouf like with a few extra thrusters and even a few under the pauldrons. But then again I feel the shape is fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this couldn't be shown no matter what but for it I had side arm mounted beam weapons on both arms that size and shape wise looked like those of the gelgoog jaeger but on the sides and a barrel that looked like the beam guns of the Dreissen.

Lastly there's the legs, they're close...but I was wanting a sleeker/a bit slimmer looking gouf flight type legs that didn't have those turbines(?) on the sides of the legs but replace them with what I think are thrusters on the back of the legs and a set on the inner side of the legs as well to give it a very hover capable and fast look.

Hey guys, I was researching and I have some doubts about these events, if someone can help me I will be grateful:

What was that Gundam Big Bang Project? it is always announced along with the Endless Waltz / 08 Ms team trailer.

Was Gundam's 20 year anniversary event held in 1998 and 1999? starting in 1998 in the case.

Was Gundam The Movie (Endless Waltz Special Edition and The 08th MS Team Miller's Report) released in theaters across the country? or was it only released at the 20 year old Gundam event?

I was curious to know about this release in theaters, just a meeting that was released on August 1, what I know with a Gundam event, so I was in doubt if it was released in theaters across the country, or was released only at that event.

Now that I got that out of the way. Let's talk about how those same wings were useless in seed destiny. Upon my first watch of seed destiny when shinn receives the destiny and first uses the wings of light it gave me the impression that the wings of light increased the destiny's speed tremendously. But lo and behold when the destiny came up against the strike freedom and infinite justice they were keeping up with the destiny no problem. And the after image stuff didn't work on them either. 

So ultimately the wings of light were pointless. Cause they gave shinn no advantage in battle with the srike freedom and infinite justice. And considering that the wings of light was the premier feature of the destiny gundam. That definitely leaves me with the feeling of the destiny gundam being lackluster.

Some friends and I have started a gaming organization and we are looking to get involved in Maxi Boost ON as we are big fans! Also, we're looking to be a knowledge hub not just for MBON but for other upcoming fighting games too.

Also I believe that the tb timeline is a parallel universe of u.c.
The oyw ended like the original (minus the more advanced tech)

Brings me to my first series of questions / confusion:

Was there a char and amuro? They never have been mentioned now have they? Yet the Gundam exists and is a symbol of hope.

And since the full armors base is a RX-78-2 it can be assumed that it also was the first Gundam model.

So Amuro could have existed I suppose. What do you think?
I just doubt that he would have stayed in an RX-78-2 till the end of the war. Maybe a full armor too?

Also I get a feeling that more gundams have been deployed in general to get that sort of notoriety.

Also do you feel the Atlas is an upgrade? Never liked the design and it made me wonder the status of rail guns in the Gundam universe. This iteration makes me think it should be comparable if not better then beam weaponry.

In 00 for example it was relatively weak.

What it's strength in Seed was, I don't know. Only the duel seemed to have used it.

They both have similar history, lovers, siblings, rivals, and antagonists. They even rebel against reigning government (Britannia and Earth Federation, Zabi, and Titans) through a rebellion (Black Knights and Zeon, AEUG, and Neo Zeon).

Lelouch though is an ordinary student mc who just happens to stumble upon a conflict and a supernatural power that gave him the chance to rise on top of the world by starting wars by a world wide revolution then a huge war by becoming the world's hated enemy to end all conflicts forever before his resurrection and attempt to erase Geass that are being abused from the face of the planet.

Char started off as a rival to Amuro and an antagonist with intentions to restore his father's ideology by wiping out the Zabi then to remove the corruption from the Federation only to lead him to force his ideals upon Earth in an extreme manner.

The two went through many developments and were tragic in a somewhat manner. Their fate too were debatable whether or not they are alive or dead.

However Char's personality is split into the likes of Kallen, Schneizel, Orpheus, Shin, Ashley, and Oiaguro. 

Even Mcgillis who shares the same seiyuu as Suzaku had the same motivations as Suzaku, wore a mask, and attempted to change the world through a white mobile suit with dual wield swords and energy wings only to get his ass kicked by his rival who has the same seiyuu as Shin.

Rules: (Different this time around)

1. 1 vote per person
2. Whichever form of a particular MS is listed, that's the one competing. (No assuming final forms/weapons, etc. So the specific suit listed, is what you're voting on.)
3. 1 vs 1. Equal footing
4. Pilots are a factor (Example - McGillis Farheed would pilot both Grimgerde and Bael. - Duo Maxwell would pilot Deathscythe Hell, [Johann Trinity](https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Johann_Trinity) in Throne Eins, etc.)
5. One round per day - Results posted after.

In addition, how do the different types of beam shields compare against beam sabers in the Cosmic Era? I remember seeing the ZAFT beam shields blocking beam sabers without a solid shield component (whenever the Legend and Strike Freedom clash with beam sabers before smacking their beam shields against each other).

Either way, Glemy comes along in ZZ, starts his rebellion and then it ends leaving NZ in shambles for 6 years.   


I think that the original ZZ plot would have had Char working with Haman, until Char mistrusted Haman enough again to step out of the shadows and rise up, claiming his place in lead of NZ in 0088 instead of waiting until 0093? So, rather than throw the entire civil war plot of ZZ out, they came up with Glemy, made him look like Char and a member of the Zabi family, or at least supposedly one, to give him the draw he would need to actually lead a rebellion in such a short period of time. I havent reat Beltochika's Children, so I dont know if Glemy is rerferenced at all there, but it seems possible that Glemy is JUST a stand in for Char because Char became off limits to the show.

In particular Garma and Dozle.

Reading through the Origin, and from what I remember from the anime, both of these guys had a soft spot in them. Garma definitely seems to be the most tender between them, and really seems to care about the spacenoid independence. Seems that he was manipulated pretty easily into doing what he did, such as his Kycilia and Gihren pushing him to be a ""Zabi man.""
Plus his whole relation with that daughter of the New York mayor too, humanizes him a bit 

Dozle on the other hand, takes me as a guy that will not hesitate to throw down if needed, and is very loyal to his family, but he certainly got manipulated alot as well, due to his less than stellar intelligence that we have seen. Feels like he really fell into the ""big, strong but dumb"" role that his family really pushed him into.

But his relationship with his wife, and especially Mineva marks him as a tender guy. He even expressed regret over having been a part of Operation British and the whole ""half of humanity"" was killed.

Irregardless, they were still compliant with the whole ordeal so I don't feel too bad about them biting the bullet, but definitely much more sympathetic than the other three siblings.

- An *actually new* Gundam Breaker_ as said i love GB3, New Gundam Breaker it was hard to digest for me: the whole visual novel progression with gunpla waifu routes it's something not suited for me. 
So bring back some aspect of that or...

- A ""new"" themed ""Gundam Breaker"": I'd like something more like 3, but also with the newer GBN of Re: Build Divers's serie in mind i won't say no to a gunpla mmo. Where you can customize you own gunpla and fight with other people online. With pve, pvp and ""realm vs realm"".

- newer branches of Versus / Maxi boost : I know that are a bit different kind of games, but with newer gundam series probably it's good to expand their roosters

- newer Dynasty Warrior: i don't know how these games are considered by fans, but it's seems fun to expand even them

- last but not least, **my personal opinion** : a story-driven gundam videogame. Both a newer story that connects some dots with main gundam series, both an already established plot but you'll follow it by playing it. 
In the first case, i'd say a story after Victory that will arrive to G-Saviour. 
In the second case, i'd say a whole Astray-X-Delta-Frame-Vs Seed and Seed Destiny sidestories.

Galactic Empire/First Order/ Final Order: Designed to be easy to manufacture,focusing on a single line rather than various models with specialised variants. Gundams and Mobile Armor are used as terror weapons as proscribed in the Tarkin Doctrine and entrusted to top agents of the Emperor. They have GM-style visors for their grunt suits. No hyperdrives on most mobile suits save for specialised variants of their grunt suits and their Gundams.  


Galactic Republic/ Rebellion/ New Republic/ Resistance: They tend to have various models of mobile suits in their service similar to that of Zeon (fortunately for them, they have a Unified Maintenance Plan first to reduce the logistical tangleweed). Mobile Suits used by them tend to have a hyperdrive equipped for hit and run strikes (except for mobile suit units in ground combat roles) and to operate some distance away from a carrier ship. Gundams are used as high performance mobile suits for aces. All mobile suits used by the Galactic Republic/Rebellion/New Republic/ Resistance use a mono-eye system except for their Gundams.  


Trade Federation/ Separatists: Easy to manufacture (even more so than the Empire since the majority of their soldiers tend to be battle droids, so no life support and no hyperdrive ) with a quantity over quality approach in combat with their mobile suits. Mobile Suits used by the Trade Federation/ CIS tend to have the cockpits located in their heads (a disadvantage in combat since nailing the head also takes out the pilot but they use easily replaceable battle droids so the weakness is moot for them) and a Leo-style optic system.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,80406,public,self,,,Mobile Suit Design Ideas for a Star Wars/Gundam mash up,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/hprp55/mobile_suit_design_ideas_for_a_star_warsgundam/,,all_ads,6,news,4deca144-5eba-11e8-87bd-0e550d339522,Probably Bullshit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scirrocco it seemed to have his own thing going on around him, being cunning, getting the ladies (except moa),  and possibly being the first newtype we see fully self aware and able to use his powers atleast till the end. Of which its still not clear why his machine stopped responding in the end.

As I understand newtype powers (atleast as far as zeta is concerned) allows you to be telepathic and by extension empathetic to other people, something the show(s) push for- understanding one another.

After that I never spoke about Gundam in person aside few people and online. I realized that Gundam as a franchise means more than an anime, it is something that I treasure the most in my life because of the lessons I taught that molded me into who I am today. A lot of the stuff that Gundam shows is related from the previous world wars and what the future will eventually become of Earth. Especially with the mature theme, strong characters, and artwork proves that Gundams aren't robots and prove to be the best mecha shows in the decade for future generations to come.

Yet I still post stuff online and focus more on life by applying what Gundam taught meaning that should be enough to show what Gundam is even in a subtle manner.

Unlike most anime franchises, there are no annoying fans that I encountered and any real Gundam fan is a friend of mine.

Gundam as a franchise has a number of fantastic tracks, but if I were to pick my favorites they would definitely be:

- Meguriai. It's such a great song, be it the [original version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igz6zQ5fkMk) that plays at the end of the third Gundam 0079 film, or the [version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwpoEnKDjvQ) featured in the Origin anime. Yes my sweet, YES MY SWEETEST!

- Z Toke wo Koete. This track alongside the great animation cemented Zeta's first opening as one my top anime OPs of all time. An I love the [full version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNZVb9IggJQ)!

- Anime Ja Nai. Gundam's first live-action foray's opening may be cheesy yes, but [Anime Ja Nai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRZhbQuG1n8) is such an earworm! ZZ needs more love!

- ETERNAL WIND. Starts off as a good, if pretty standard [80s ballad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63JOZ3BxsGw) until around 2:46 when it kicks into power ballad mode. Absolutely love the percussion in this track!

- STAND UP TO THE VICTORY. The contrast between [this song's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TzWaKfhgK4&amp;list=RD63JOZ3BxsGw&amp;index=3) tone and the actual tone of the series will never not be amusing to me. I think the dissonance is part of why I love it. That and the brass instruments.

- WINNERS FOREVER. [Pure 80s rock and roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCc1khUVeEs&amp;list=RD63JOZ3BxsGw&amp;index=22) (despite Victory Gundam being a 90s anime). I can't help but want to scream ""Winners forever!"" when listening to it.

- Turn A Turn. I used to think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdUvGkOCj3A) was an odd and somewhat dated-sounding song for a late 90s anime such as Turn A Gundam, but I've come to love how dramatic it sounds. The singers sounds like he's giving it his absolute all, which I love. Also the addition of Mongolian throat singing and traditional Japanese flutes really adds a unique flavor to this song.

- Daybreak's Bell. You can't get more Visual Kei than [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4OvNa0TqLk) (though Gackt comes close). I really like how sorrowful, yet somehow motivating this song sounds. Gundam 00 was the first Gundam show I watched and so this track has a special place in my heart.

- Raise Your Flag. Didn't end up enjoying IBO as much as I would've liked to, but [Raise Your Flag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-UN6uRMBRw) is definitely a banger.

When the Gundams start doing the really crazy psycommu/psycofield stuff towards the end of the series, the really...for lack of a better word, supernatural stuff, I started wondering: is there any information on the people and process behind the design of these mobile suits? Like did the Anaheim engineers intend for the Unicorn and Banshee to be able to go apeshit-crystal-supernova mode, and if so, is there anything in the U.C. continuum that talks about that? I guess what I’m looking for, ideally, is some sort of...in-universe psycoframe design document. I have a copy of Anaheim Journal, but my written/read Japanese isn’t anywhere near good enough to be able to understand it, and as far as I’ve been able to find, the wiki doesn’t fully explain the kinds of stuff I’m looking for.

And, as you can guess from the title, he recently finished 08th MS Team. These are the questions I asked him.

**First off, how do you feel about the protagonists, Shiro and Aina?**

I like them. Pretty well rounded, and I like how they described their backstory and how it lead them to where they are, without shoving it into your face. They gave just enough information to understand why all the characters act the way they do.

**How do you feel about the supporting cast, i.e. the rest of the 08th MS team, the Zeon soldiers fleeing from Odessa, and so on?**

The 08th squad is pretty cool, though the Zeon troops didn't quite get as much attention as I would like. Shiro and Aina are very much the stars of the show, everyone else just felt like they were merely supporting cast. Which caused the Admiral and his forces to feel like they were simply there so the view can keep track of the time of events, rather then actually being relevant. The Admiral also serving the double function of showing how insane our Zeon antagonist got.

**Speaking of the Federation and Zeon, how do you feel about how they were portrayed in this series?**

Much better display of how both sides are filled with good people, but lead by cruel bastards. Which is the overarching plot of the setting. Was nice to see them more actively show off dissidence among the ranks; though I wish they'd show it a bit more among the soldiers rather then just the upper ranks.

**Do you think the Federal Forces were right in investigating Shiro for treason?**

So being viewers, we have the benefit of meta knowledge, and are a bit caught up in the character romance. But if you actually pull out, not only should Shiro had been investigated for treason, he's lucky he wasn't judged guilty and executed. From the angle of the Federation, you have a soldier who went MIA and was discovered to be fraternizing with an enemy ranking officer; and willingly let her go without a fight. That's a major red flag.

**Speaking of Shiro and Aina, how do you feel about their romance plot?**

I liked it. It was the focus of the story, rather then being a distraction; so it wasn't like it's out of place. As I said though, I wish the story covered a little more ground, so the side characters didn't feel like they were filling the background so much.

**How do you feel about the setting, being in South-East Asia and irregular guerilla fighters being a constant presence?**

Bit of a lack of a role for them in the macro plot. I assume they turn into something later on, but as is they're a bit shoehorned in. You just have a group of people fighting both the Fed and Zeon, yet don't explain why they they aren't on a specific side. Honestly they're lucky the Federation didn't just say fuck it, torch the towns of suspected rebels. We've seen the Federation higher ups don't give a shit about how bit the numbers are, just so long as the result is victory. So random militias attacking them sounds like a quick way to be deemed traitor to the federation; and to be killed with the same prejudice as the Zeon.

**What do you think about Project Apsalus?**

I like how they showed off it is a death star weapon, but also that it isn't some all mighty weapon that could never be defeated; obviously cause we saw it get defeated. That said though, I would actually now argue the admiral and me were wrong. If you got something like that, you absolutely could take the war to the ground. I still think the invasion was premature, and shouldn't have been done to start, but seeing the power of the Apsalus, and the fact they did technically have it down in time for the final battle; if Zeon had doubled down and tried to get it done a bit sooner, they could have turned the war around. Forced the Federation fleets to turn around and redeploy to save earth. Otherwise they'd had risked taking Zeon, at the cost of losing earth, causing a phase of the war where the sides are inverted. Also if they deployed that thing to the final battle it likely could have won the last battle.

**Are there any mobile suits that stood out to you?**

They were all models we've seen before, save the MS our main cast was using. That said though, I am glad the Gouf got a bit more of a highlight reel. Really showed off terrifying it is among the normal ranks. Though I feel the Dom got a bit skimped, despite being supposedly a superior model.

**What did you think about the epilogue?**

Shiro and Aina are complete assholes. Why the fuck wouldn't you take the kids with you!? Other than that though, I thought it was nice, and the wholesome ending is nice. I'm glad they are keeping the trend of how the world is a nicer place once the war is over; even if we know it doesn't last. Goes well with the anti war message of the series.

**Overall, what did you think of the 08th MS team?**

Enjoyable group, It's really hard to have a group of that size seem cohesive without them being lawful good boy scouts, or it feeling like they're artificially glued together cause the plot needs them together. They have friction, but you can also see the friction doesn't break them apart.

**And finally, what do you think about the series as a whole?**

So GotL Wing Zero is first built as Wing Proto Zero. Which looks cool and I'm glad we got the MG for it, but it's completely ridiculous how this one, single, totally out of place TV design got forced into the middle of an EW-based canon just to advertise the MG. They didn't do that for the Wing Gundam TV MG, so I don't get why tf did they had to get so stupid with the Wing Zero TV MG. I've written fanfics that were more coherent.

ANYWAY that's not the point I'm trying to make. So then this ""Wing Proto Zero"" gets all screwed up in one fight with the Deathscythe, and it gets rebuilt as the proper version of Wing Zero from EW. Except now its gaudy angel wings were ripped off of an unrelated Tallgeese mod and shoved onto a Gundam they weren't originally intended for? And I'm guessing parts of the Wing Gundam EW (the one with the metal wings and the fancy colors) went into building this Wing Zero EW (the one with the big fluffy angel wings), since they use the exact same frame and armor when you take the backpack off. But if that's the case, what happened to the scenes from the TV show where Heero was piloting Wing Zero and Lady Une was piloting the original Wing Gundam simultaneously?

From what I can tell, we went from

Original Anime Timeline: This is just the same Wing Zero you saw in the show, but now we have a movie budget so we're going to make it look more pretty.

Adjusted Manga Timeline: The Wing Zero you saw in the show isn't Wing Zero. The Wing Zero from the show is actually Wing Zero Zero.

I’ve really gotten into anime the past couple years. For a long time I was the guy who scoffed at anime as nothing more than a silly cartoon genre only really weird people watched ( yeah, I know, guys.). But I decided to watch a couple my friends recommended and was hooked. Ive watched a good little chunk of anime, and am always looking for more. 

But a while ago I started IBO. Immediately I was completely immersed in this world. I was invested in so many characters. I felt like I was part of the group. Like I could relate and connect with these kids. One of my friends warned me this show could be very Game of Thrones-like. I thought I could handle it. I couldn’t. So many deaths hit me like a train. I spent so many episodes wiping tears from my eyes after watching them. And that damn outro song in the first season did not help either. 

I finished the show this morning. I binged the last 6 episodes because I could not sleep without knowing what happens. I spent the last few episodes, quite literally shaking in my seat, fighting back tears. I definitely cried like a little baby on the last few scenes. Bittersweet has a whole new meaning to me. I don’t even know what to say. Im glad Orga/Mika and all the original Tekkadans dreams came true, and they accomplished their original purpose. But I actually feel like I lost real life friends. Tbh, I don’t know why I’m making this post? To vent? To ask for people to talk about it with? Counseling (lol)? I have no clue. 

I feel horrible for judging anime so much for most my life. I get it now. After watching all these great shows, I truly do get it. Maybe tomorrow I wont feel like my heart was ripped out. 

If anyone has a great Gundam I should watch next, hit me with it. This is great stuff.

This is the truth the Vist Foundation and the Earth Federation government doesn't want you to hear about Haro ! Haro has been instrumental to the history of the Universal Century ! Behold, the manifesto ! 

&gt;alright so psycommu and psyco frames are shown to use human emotion and spirit to alter the universe and how the objects in it react to one another and itself. And newtypes are the ones who can use them as they have been in space and can understand one another. We have also seen how newtypes can be created artificially as cyber-newtypes creating a fusion of technology and human emotion/spirit. 

&gt; What im getting to is that the lines between humanity and machine are less solid the further into the future we go. Now lets look back. Who have we seen since the very beginning, and he may just appear just a little bit but he is there nonetheless. Haro. Haro was seen during The Origin when Amuro drops Haro out of the box in the airport. Haro has also been seen in every continuation of Universal Century and even the unrelated universe of Gundam 00. 

&gt; How does this all link together, Haro is from the future, soooo far off into the future that we cant even see and what hes done is absorb the fragments of humanity in order to use the power of psycho frames to go back in time or even cross dimensions to get to Gundam 00. Haro stands for Humanity Altering Reality Object, and he went back to the very beginning of humanity itself to set forth all of the events that we as the viewers have beared witness to. HARO is the reason for the One Year War, he is the reason for AEUG, he is the reason the Gundams exist, he is the reason Space Colonies exist. Why does he do it, why would he create such a horrific chain of events? Because he has seen a darker future and came to save humanity from it, HARO is the necessary evil.

Just how many of you are binge watching long form shows like MSG,Z, ZZ and to some extent SEED?  


I am not saying either way is good or bad, but I have to figure that when I started watching Gundam, finding stuff outside of Wing was difficult. Even 0083 took me nearly a year to watch as I had to hunt down bootlegs of DVDs or suffer the early days of file sharing.  


What I am getting at is this: MSG, Zeta and ZZ were all released as weekly shows, and as such were designed in such a way that there was a built in break between episodes. The pacing when watching 5 or 6 episodes of Zeta in a row is kinda bad, but I am watching about 1 episode a day and find it fine. I think the accessibility of an entire season of these older shows creates its own problems, as people want to consume them in a relatively short amount of time.  SEED suffered from this as a lot of animation is reused and if you see  it if you are watching it back to back. Newer shows like 00 and IBO pace differently because their audiences watch differently.   


Anyways, just my thought. Please answer the poll!

Zeon like PLANT wanted to fight for independence from the Federation but the Zabi Family and Haman are the reason it is corrupt.

It was SO good. 

I'm doing a UC Rewatch, and I've only seen IBO, Thunderbolt, Build Fighters, and Try beforehand. I've legitimately never been this moved by a Gundam show since Zeta, I've never cried because of an anime before, but jesus this OVA hit different. The pacing is incredible, you get enough time to soak in what this colony is like but also what the current climate of the war is, and how Zeon and the Federation function at the moment. 

Bernie is one of my favorite Gundam characters now, aside from Kamille, Mashymre, and a few others. The scene of him listening in on that drunk redhead and then calling Al was so good, and Al's little ""I love you Bernie"" at the end only makes his death so much more tragic. 

It's wild that Chris never finds out who the Zaku pilot was, I was assuming that they'd expose each other somehow during the fight, or Al would at least reveal that she killed Bernie at the end. 

The parts where Al's friends are glamorizing war when Al cries at the end is so fucked, because they're just kids and don't understand what he's been through, but Al basically lost a *brother* because of the war, and it's kind of ironic, since the Gryps Conflict would be happening seven years later. 

This was such a good OVA, and such a step up in quality since ZZ and CCA.

I think its safe to say that Char is easily 1 of the most influential villians / antiheroes ever created in anime. We all know about the char clones / homages in Gundam but it got me thinking, who are the best char clones outside of Gundam? Im not just on about mask wearing rivals to the main character, but characters who have similar backgrounds, motives, personalities to the red comet in anime, videogames and other media.

Straight away, 1 example that is quite obvious is Lelouch from Code Geass. Both are essentially exiled princes whose parents are killed by an evil politician and both live under false identities whilst living within the oppresive regimes and are renowned for their masked personas. Both also end up overthrowing the old regimes who killed their parents and in turn end up turning the world against them in order to unify the world / end conflict. 

Another example from anime I can think of is Vegeta from dragonball. Both are princes whose parents were murdered by villians of the repsective series. Both end up working for the vilians as ace soldiers whilst plotting revenge against the villians. they also have rivals who start the series weaker than themselves before being able to match and surpass them. both char and vegeta end up becoming allies with amuro and goku respectively, only to become villians again later in the series. 

In videogames, the main villians from Persona 5 (Shido) and Persona 5 Royal &gt;!(Maruki)!&lt; can both be considered char clones. the shido bossfight is quite obviously a homage to char as he wears a uniform similar to char's in 0079 and rides atop a golden beast who is a reference to Hyaku shiki in the sense that it is resistant / reflects non-physical attacks. Similarly, P5Rs villian (or rather antihero) is a tragic figure whose main motivation for his villianous actions are to unify the world in order to end suffering, and he also happens to be a masked villian.

When I went into them, Seed was the one I had the lowest expectations for, because all I ever heard about Seed, was the hate. I went in with negative expectations, and I don’t know how, but the show won me over. By the end I absolutely loved it, and it’s now one of my top 5 Gundam shows (I have seen about 80% of all animated Gundam material). 

To elaborate: 

At first I wasn’t on board with it at all. It was kinda melodramatic, annoying, and the plot points lifted from 0079 did stick out really badly. But about at the half way point, I really grew to like it, and once it dropped the 0079 remake angle, it improved alot. The battle at Alaska is also another really cool part of the show. The reveal that the Federation is as villainous as Zaft was interesting, Kira’s comeback in the freedom was cool, and the Cyclops systems activation was horrifying. The two battles at Orb were another highlight. I am a huge sucker for enemies becoming allies, and thus I really liked Dearka and Athrun choosing the good side. Athrun and Kira working together while they were escaping to space, was a goosebumps inducing moment. 
It was at this point in the show, I had grown attached to all of the Characters, so it was real heartbreaking to see Badgirule and Ramius be forced to fight it out. Mu’s death was one of the hardest hitting gundam deaths. Badgirule and Flay got to redeem themselves for their asshole behavior in the first half, and Badgirule went out like a boss (her battle with Azrael being one of the more intense human vs human fights in gundam).  
Overall, this has to be one of my all time favorite final battles in Gundam. It had such a large scale and epic scope to it (reminding me a lot of Star wars), while also remaining simple and focused. The whole finale was intense and high stakes as all hell. Overall it left me with a very positive feeling.  

The positives: 

Two things that the show did well from the start was showing that war is no joke (with how brutal, unforgiving and intense war really is) and the military is no joke (compared to most Gundam shows, this shows military is very harsh and serious, with much technical jargon being thrown around).

The conflict of the show was an interesting one, and the themes were strong. The show had a very mature and serious feel to it (especially compared to the more standard anime-esque Destiny).

The OST was amazing. The first ED is now one of my favorite anime eds. 

While the show does remake 0079 for the first half, it is still original enough, that it isn’t 1:1 copy.

Rau takes center stage as the best character. I just loved that guy and he is now my favorite Gundam villain ever. He is so evil, insane and hammy. The amazing performance by Mark Oliver really helped. Rau is the darkest Char clone out there. He has a cool twist, and its so fun to see him manipulate the two hitlers of the respective sides, while also slowly losing his mind. His rants and his theme (birth of secretion) were perfect, and the Providence is awesome.

As for characters, I hated most of them at first, but they grew on me. Flay was a standout at how annoying and unlikable she was at first, but even she gets some character growth by the end and I appreciated what they wanted to do with her. Mu, Ramius, Badgirule, Rau, Athrun, Dearka, Yzak, Waltfeld and Lacus all make for a very likeable supporting cast, that while rough at first, they really grew on me over time. Mu was an absolute standout. He was the most likable supporting character in all of Gundam. He perfectly balanced his roles as a father figure, a badass and an occasional source of comedy.

Azrael and Patrick are one dimensional insane racists, but even they had their standout moments, and both felt like serious threats. Azrael especially stole many scenes in the final battle. 

I did not have much to complain about Kira, He was an average Gundam mc at best. 

I’m also gonna give some criticism, so I don’t look like a blind fanboy. The stock footage is a problem. The art was lacking in some aspects, but the HD remaster fixed some of the flaws. The sameface is kinda annoying. Some of the love story elements were cheesier than usual. Kira was kinda blander as a protagonist, after he came back from death. And both Kira and Andrew surviving giant explosions, was something hard to overlook. That’s about all I dislike about it. 

Overall, I went into it, fully expecting to hate it, and I came out loving it.

We’re more than halfway through this motherfucker of a year! Congrats on having made it this far; you’re over the hump!

I’m currently working on building one of my absolute favourite mobile suits, the MG Sinanju Stein from Gundam Narrative. However, it occurred to me this morning that despite my love for its design, I’ve never actually seen the movie it’s from, and I’d like to change that. 

I’m in the middle of a massive undertaking in which I’m attempting to watch just about every bit of animated Gundam media there is. So far I’ve watched Wing/EW, G, IBO, Thunderbolt, the original MSG, I’m partway through 08th MS Team, and I’ve watched about half of Unicorn (I made the mistake of starting with Unicorn, before realising that I needed to know a *lot* more about the UC in order to have any idea what the fuck was going on). 

So, my question to you all is: what do I need to know in order to appreciate/understand Narrative? It takes place...after Unicorn, am I right in thinking that? Do I need to have watched all of Unicorn? Or, as a movie, is it designed to be appreciated as a standalone piece of work? If there *is* some stuff that I *need* know going into it, is there a way I can bone up on that without having to...y’know, watch most of the UC, are there any easily digestible resources you guys would recommend (I’ve tried and failed to find a decent UC synopsis that isn’t just reading summaries episode-by-episode on the wiki). 

Anyways, yeah, any advice you guys could offer would be much appreciated. As ever, I love how friendly the Gundam/Gunpla community is, especially compared to the majority of the internet; you guys are awesome, don’t ever let anyone tell you otherwise. Hope you’re all staying safe and healthy.

I “technically” count the group formation as of July 4th since that’s when I bought the old zeonic-corps domain, but the first project (Gundam Sentinel) was started on October 6th, 2003. So in every right, I’ve been doing this stuff for almost seventeen years! Yikes! I still wonder where all the time goes and whether I’ll ever truly have the website that is outlined flawlessly in the back of my mind. One day I’ll pay for a modern layout with all the bells and whistles and get cracking on porting everything over, or one day a magic coding fairy/wizard will grace me with their presence and aide me on my quest. Every year I keep saying that I’ll get more projects done, but I seem to get further and further behind (although do I?).

I have a terrible habit of forgetting the anniversary of that which I love to do. But this year I remembered! Hurray! I’m still one of the only people continuing to do this stuff, and it amazes me that after so many years, the hatred and animosity from the anons online are still there. I’m too slow, I have too many things, blah blah blah. I honestly don’t care anymore, and I never really did. They can bugger off for all I care. They still download and reference whatever it is I put out anyway, so go figure.

Nonetheless, I continue along my path of Gundam fandom translating. I never imagined that I’d end up getting banned from the Gundam Wiki because I corrected too many gross errors that they made.  Ah well. Haters gonna hate. I still have the goal in my head to get my own Gundam Project/Gundam.com type of site officially up and running, but I’ve become so accustomed to the hodgepodge style of this website it’s almost pointless. One day. One day.

Anyways, that’s all I had to say. To the many friends I’ve made over the years, thank you for your help! To the staff that tirelessly worked on my projects: I’m still indebted. To the fans who continue to donate to see these projects come to light: you are what keep me going. Don’t ever give up. Without you, I don’t even bother.

Thank you all. Let’s see how much longer I can keep the light burning.

So, in celebration of 16+ years, I’ve got two translations for you!

I find Soul Society Arc to be a reminiscent of the Gundam Wing portion where both Aizen and Treize manipulated the good guys into dealing with the wrong people for their own ends with themes of chivalry, nobility, and morality. The United Earth Sphere Alliance and Soul Society are governments full of arrogant pricks while the Rukongai and the Colonies are left to fight and deal with oppression.

Winter War in both series dealt with the final battle of Treize and Aizen leading an all out war just to act as if they are doing the bad but have a deeper wish that things can be for the better for their own desires.

Mod Souls and Mobile Dolls are identical as both are ai enhanced cyborgs meant to fight.

I know that many of its members would go on to found Londo bell to replace the Titans. I personally believe this to be a cynical attempt by the feddies to placate the colonies by placing the duty of removing radical Zeon movements in their own hands. However, how did AEUG itself die out? Was it just a lack of manpower and finances or did the leadership legitimately think that rejoining the Federation was the best move forward to protect the rights of spacenoids after the first Neo Zeon war?

 As much as I like Londo Bell but they seem powerless to fight against the Federation's more oppressive acts, baring the few occasions they bear their teeth such as at the climax of the third Neo Zeon war.  In a perfect world I would have liked the AEUG to remain a neutral faction shutting down the excessive violence committed by both the Feddies and Zeeks. Of course I know that is not realistic but I would still like to know how they met their end.    

&amp;#x200B;

My second question is this. During the formation of AEUG it was made up of both ex Federation and Zeon members. During the Gryps war Axis Zeon returned and claimed legitimate ruler-ship via Mineva Zabi and then during the second Char used his linage to claim rule of the same. Did any members of the AEUG defect to either Neo Zeon movement? I can Imagine the second might have been an even greater draw since Char had been the former Leader of AEUG.

It didn't go so well. I found the gundam-on-gundam(not GINN) battles anti-climactic and there were other issues but that's not the point I wanted to address.

I got through most of the ""desert"" arch but I couldn't continue. I just have run into too many similarities between SEED and the original MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM.
__________________________________________________________

For example:
-The Archangel looks strikingly like White Base.
-Kira is pensive and has hangups about actually getting in the fight. I love and expect a good Char clone but I'm not so sure about Amuro clones
-There is an Ace on the crew that seems at least as good as the protagonist but instead simply pilots a fighter.
-No nuke access
-You can even draw some solid parallels between the Desert Tiger and Ramba Ral.

Heard Victory Gundam is the first depressing and bleak series and there hasn't been any series that depressing since then.

00 2nd season was pretty dark but not bleak enough since the theme is for humans to understand each other.

IBO 2nd season ended in a bitter manner with the style of the GOT plus some moments aren't really that dark enough to make it hopeless to the standards of Stargazer and Victory.

I can't think of a series that hopeless other than Stargazer. Opening dealt with the asteroid hitting the Earth to break peace apart to lead an all out war in both EA and DSSD that deals with children being soldiers, death counts on both sides, slaughter of refugees to justify one's cause, and the defeat of the protagonist by the antagonist to gather a small ounce of hope to survive with an clueless interpretation until the manga confirms their survival.

Stargazer Gundam represents the hope in the show while Strike Noir is meant to represent the darkness that resulted from the tragedy.

And, just like I did [when he watched Gundam 0079](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/gmvk4e/a_friend_of_mine_watched_gundam_0079_for_the/), I made sure to ask him some questions as a relative newcomer to the Universal Century of Gundam, or of Gundam as a whole, really. After all, everyone loves first time reactions. So, here are the questions I asked and his answers.

**First off, what did you think of the show overall?**

Pretty solid overall. Might have benefited from an extra episode, just cause it felt a bit rushed in that last episode.

**How do you feel about the Earth Federation and the Principality of Zeon now?**

Zeon is still evil. Not a whole lot was added to them. They're still a faction of good people lead by assholes. Though unlike the first show, it does show off a bit better how the Federation are also assholes. Literally using ""A million deaths is a statistic"" argument to defend civilian deaths.

**What do you think of the main characters?**

Al is a child character well written, though that kid is very much not right in the head, and I don't just mean being overly fascinated with giant robots and war. At the start the kid seemed to have a complete disregard for violence and the destruction around him, and even toward the end, despite it finally having an impact on him, he seemed to have a ""This is fine"" attitude toward decisions that would continue said destruction and violence.

Bernie is the poster boy for ""Zeons are good, Zeon is bad."" Good guy who happens to be in the wrong profession.

Chris is the poster girl for ""Feds are good, Federation is bad."" Pretty much the same thing. Her and Bernie are pretty much the same character just on the opposite side, and opposite genders. Even though she is the one that dropped the ""It's just a number"" line, you can tell she agrees and was answering how she was told to.

Principal, put the head of Zeon and the Federation in a room across from her, and the war would be over in 10 minutes. Women would put the fear of god into anyone.

**What do you think about Operation Rubicon and Colonel Killing?**

""You're on a suicide mission that if you fail we'll just nuke it anyways. So we need you to clear out so we can start loading the nukes.""

Really just a waste of special forces troops. Really felt like Zeon was throwing a coin before they threw the rock in.

**What do you think of the mobile suits in this series?**

Zaku proves itself once more as the best robot. Though seeing the Doms and other models getting a bit of the spotlight.

**What did you think about the Kampfer?**

Very solid design. Though you get a nice display of its potential, would be nice to see a display of its actually efficiency. Fighting enemies who have less experience, were caught unaware, while you had a set up stockpile of weapons and munitions is more something you use to demo to a military brass; rather then showing off how hard it actually fights in a live combat situation. If that makes sense.

**If it helps any, the Kampfer was solely designed for hit-and-run tactics.**

So it was in its element, but need to see how it goes when its out of its element before you can say how good it is. When you have a bunch of designs with similar jobs, the one that can operate outside of its element will often be the better design.

**Moving on, how do you think Amuro would've done if he had managed to get the Gundam Alex as intended? In time for the assault on A Baoa Qu, at least.**

He would have ripped apart Alex to upgrade the RX-78-2 Gundam. He has too much of a personal attachment to just abandon the RX-78-2 Gundam for an ""upgraded"" Gundam.

**It's funny that you mention that, since a lot of video games have it so that Amuro curb-stomps and kills Char in the Zeong when he has the Gundam Alex in time for the battle of A Baoa Qu.**

I don't doubt it would have worked better. But I do genuinely think he wouldn't have just replaced his Gundam.

**Anyway, what do you think about Side 6, now that you've seen more of it than in the original series?**

Dudes are lucky as fuck they didn't get nuked. I get they had the Federation there to intercept the fleet, but part of the whole neutral party playing both sides, is you rely on them not realizing it. It's a very dangerous game, especially when you didn't have the means to protect yourself should one had decided to attack much sooner.

**What do you think of Bernie and Chris' final duel, and the ending of the series?**

This is why I feel it needed one more episode. They had to cramp the build up, fight, and ending into the last episode, when it could have done with going one episode longer.

**Any final thoughts you want to say about Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket?**

I've just finished watching Unicorn. The big addition to the Gundam lore we get in Unicorn is that the original charter of the Universal Century included a forward-looking article that would have granted self-determination to an emergent post-human society of space dwellers. For reasons that aren't fully explored, the Federation decides to suppress knowledge of that article following the Laplace incident, and instead administers the colonies without much regard for the people who live in space.

The perspective outlined in the last episode of the OVA series is that the Earth Sphere won't break out of these cyclic conflicts between Earthnoids and Spacenoids so long as the Federation won't relinquish its claims to dominion over Spacenoids.

I found that to be pretty underwhelming as big secrets go. And thinking about it, it seems to be because from my perspective Spacenoids don't have much to complain about, materially speaking. While we do occasionally see slums in the colonies, the impression I get is that living in Space in the UC is a much more attractive proposition than living on Earth, especially after the OYW. For that matter, I think it's a much more attractive proposition than living on Earth right now.

Am I misreading Gundam? As far as I can tell, the only grievances expressed by Spacenoids up until UC0096 are that they are not allowed self-determination, that the Federation treats them with neglect, and that Earthnoids are selfishly destroying the Earth.

All of which is fair enough, but it's pretty high-minded stuff. Really, I find it hard to imagine people living in such enviable comfort being mobilised by the Zabis into a fighting force capable of such terrible deeds. Am I missing something? Was there widespread hunger or unemployment on the colonies leading up to the OYW? By contrast, I find it a much easier to believe that Zeon remnants living in hardship in the asteroid belt or around Jupiter would rally to Haman's cause.

Am I guilty of discounting ideology in favour of material conditions when it comes to parsing the history of the UC?",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,79185,public,self,,,"How bad did UC Spacenoids have it, really?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/hhkgun/how_bad_did_uc_spacenoids_have_it_really/,,all_ads,6,discussion,83f4319a-5fa5-11e7-8e79-0ec8348f5b38,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This time I would be focusing on Mobile Suit weapons tech,stats and doctrine for fantasy races

Humans: Overall, the Humans would use a combined arms doctrine that blends conventional forces, Mobile Suits and magic into one solid fighting machine. They are capable of responding and adapting to new threats with mobile suits working alongside conventional forces and magic guilds to overpower enemies. When it comes to practical and dependable tech, Humanity is at the top with beam weaponry as standard issue for it's mobile suit forces. Balanced in all stats, Human mobile suits are jacks of all trades and masters of none in terms of stats.

Orcs: The inventors of the Mobile Suits in this setting, they rely on a mobile suit heavy doctrine where conventional forces are subordinate to mobile suit forces and are deployed to secure areas after the mobile suits' onslaught. Magic users such as Shamans fight alongside mobile suit teams in Orc armies and specialised variants of grunt MSes to channel and amplify the powers of magic users are common for Orcs. Like the humans, they also make use of beam weaponry such as beam rifles and beam sabers as standard issue for their mobile suits and their spiked shoulders are an Orc invention to provide an additional melee weapon in case of emergencies. Stats-wise an Orc mobile suit has better melee fighting capabilities when compared to the mobile suits of other races.

Dwarves: The firepower-orientated appearance of a Dwarven Mobile Suit belies it's use as a MBT with legs in the forces of the Dwarven race. Doctrine wise, Dwarven mobile suit forces are subordinate to conventional forces but thinking that the Dwarven race using their mobile suits this way would make them easy pushovers is a good way to send oneself to the grave as the heavy armor plating of a Dwarf MS also adds weight to melee attacks and when combined with the hammers they wield, fighting them in CQB is not a good idea. Dwarf MS can be easily outran by more agile mobile suits however. Dwarves prefer good old fashioned projectile cannons, hammers and maces for their mobile suits though unlike the Elves, they managed to mass produce their first successful efforts at beam rifles for their MSes.

Elves: Striking hard from their forests they call home, Elves emphasise mobility in their doctrine and their mobile suits are designed for this as their hover capabilities makes them the most agile conventional-sized mobile suits to be ever be encountered. Working in concert with more mythical giant creatures such as the mobile suit-sized humanoid tree Ents and the magic of their Druids who either fight on foot or in a Mobile Suit, they are here to make sure that anyone who threatens the forest would get a giant bazooka round in response to this. As Elven MSes run on a battery instead of a nuclear reactor compared to the other races due to their nature respecting ways, they pay for it in limited operation time and hence are not suited for long drawn out fights. In terms of mobile suit weaponry, Elves are masters of projectile weapons such as railguns and machine guns but they really suck at downsizing ranged beam weaponry for mobile suit use. The most recognisable mobile suit weapons of the Elven race is the heat saber which uses a superheated blade to cut through armour and the raketen bazooka, a 880mm bazooka that fires explosive rounds that are capable of blowing apart  the torso of a mobile suit.

Undead: Undead rely on outnumbering enemies with easily replaceable (some say disposable) units and their mobile suits are designed for that with thin armour which makes them quite agile when compared to the mobile suits to other races (but still beaten by the Elves in the agility department). Undead mobile suits are the easiest to repair in the field but their usage of cheap components means that their performance is the worst of all the races. They are also the only race to field mobile pods in battle, using them to beef up their number of mobile suits. In terms of the tech equipped on their suits, they often use beam rifles and beam sabers together with machine guns as standard handhelds on their mobile suits and a notorious habit of the Undead is recycling and restoring captured enemy mobile suit weapon systems for use with their own forces and scavenging the battlefield for any usable junk for use in their armies.The Undead's most notorious and terrifying mobile suit systems are the Shadesuits which are mobile suits that have their control systems possessed by the vengeful and restless spirits of the dead, combining the endurance of a mobile doll with the cunning and malice of a human mind.

Hobbits and Goblins: Hobbits and their Orc counterparts; the Goblins are the masters of miniaturised mobile suits and hit and run warfare in tight and confined environments, often retreating to one tunnel/barrow entrance only to then attack from another. In fact, they were the first to shrink mobile suits from their average height of 20m to 15m for their use in their subterranean habitats. Goblin and Hobbit mobile weapons are designed for ease of maneuverability in tight confines and are very agile above ground, outrunning even Elven mobile suits. However, they have poor propellant endurance due to their reduced height reducing the amount of propellant space in their tanks. Like the Humans and the Orcs, the Hobbits and Goblins use beam weaponry as standard issue in their mobile suits and have also invented the beam shield to provide the same amount of protection as a conventional shield in confined spaces.",True,True,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,79008,public,spoiler,,,"Fantasy Mobile Suit Weapons Tech, Stats,Design Choices and Doctrines.",0,[],0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/hg8utk/fantasy_mobile_suit_weapons_tech_statsdesign/,,all_ads,6,original,bf8a1020-6da7-11e7-b481-0e1ec61db1f0,Original Content,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1593182875.0,,

The Transformers (G1)/ Mobile Suit Gundam 0079: They're both the first entry that started it all, forming the foundation for a franchise and inspired characters, settings and plot ideas that later entries of both franchises would references to.

Beast Wars / Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: Both being the first sequel continuation of both franchises's first entry, they're both well-liked among most fans and ""becomes"" the highest standard of quality that some among the fan-bases think that would've never be surpassed ever.

Beast Machines / Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ: The ""odd-ball"" 3rd entries of both franchises, having quite a base-breaking reputation among the fanbase; where some thinks that it's a step down from the previous entries, while some are quite fond of them and think that they're perfectly fine standalone shows for what they were.

Car Robots / Mobile Fighter G Gundam: Both are the first AU series of their respective franchises, with a more hot-blooded ""battle shounen"" theme going on and didn't take everything too seriously. Being quite the departure from the original, some do like them for what they are and don't mind the less serious tone (Also, both has a cheesy english dub)

Unicron Trilogy / Gundam SEED &amp; SEED Destiny: Being another major AU entries of their respective franchises, both starts out rough but improves as both shows goes on, they dare trying out new things that breaks from the mold and In the end, both Armada and Gundam SEED are fondly remembered by a portion of their fanbase and the appreciation grows as time goes on. Both the Unicron Trilogy and Cosmic Era of Gundam also has their sequel shows which starts out perfectly fine with potentially interesting setups and world-building, but both eventually falls victim to behind-the scenes drama, rushed production and unneeded executive meddling and gets even more contrived, the writing gets worse as it goes on and ends generally being worse than their already flawed predecessors.

TF: Prime / Gundam 00: Both are well-liked AU entries among their respective franchises, and are well-liked for taking a more mature tone and solid production; The well-loved reception isn't fully universal however, as they are some fans who think that they're flawed in a way that most fans just seems to ignore.

RID2015 / Gundam AGE: Targeted towards a younger target audiences than their predecessors, they're both not well-liked by the older fans and treated as a disgrace for their brand among the majority of the fanbase. They're still a few fans who like them for what they're trying to do, and some of the toys in their toyline are quite well-received.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,78983,public,self,,,An bizarre parallel I found with both Gundam and Transformers...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/hg4faz/an_bizarre_parallel_i_found_with_both_gundam_and/,,all_ads,6,news,4deca144-5eba-11e8-87bd-0e550d339522,Probably Bullshit,,,,,c029c72a-f8aa-11e3-ac67-12313d19304a,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Kira's the strongest because he's the Ultimate Coordinator."" I mean, I agree he's the best CE pilot, but I don't think it's because he's the ""Ultimate Coordinator""

I've rewatched SEED multiple times, and that was never really implied. When the flashback of his birth was revealed, the only special thing they showed about Kira was that he was the only (or most successful) Coordinator baby to be born outside of a natural womb. This is because many Coordinator babies were shown to turn out ""wrong,"" in that they would have the wrong features that their parents didn't want, i.e. the wrong hair or eye color; and these ""imperfections"" are implied to be what inspired the Ultimate Coordinator Project.  It was never said that Kira was ""stronger"" or ""smarter"" than any coordinator. From my understanding, he just happened to also be gifted with prodigious piloting skills (like 90% of Gundam protagonists, right?); Kira was only ""Ultimate"" because he was completed in an artificial womb, which means he could be modified without the natural processes of the mother's womb interfering with his development. If other coordinators had such The claim of him being the ""Ultimate Coordinator"" was more about the philosophical value to his creators of basically creating a human being inside a glass tube successfully.

People would say ""well, he modified the Strike's OS instantly and made a Natural-use OS for orb."" But that was more attributed to him already being an extremely skilled engineering student with great knowledge about machines, which is why he kept on talking about how bad the setup choices were on the Strike when he first used it. Being ""ultimate"" won't suddenly make him an expert mechanic who knows all the advanced technical terms that he kept mentioning on the first one or two episodes. It was a skill he already studied for and it just carried over well to mobile suit maintenance. The pilots of the other four gundams also modified their OS just like Kira did, except they weren't the protagonist, so they didn't have to recite Kira's creepy voodoo incantations.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,78901,public,self,,,"Is Kira really ""stronger"" than other Coordinators just because he's the ""Ultimate Coordinator""?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/hfhyh4/is_kira_really_stronger_than_other_coordinators/,,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,13c7d4b0-ba69-11e3-8621-12313d21b86e,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My favorite, G Gundam.  Now hear me out before your judge.  I know G Gundam is regarded as the Black Sheep of the franchise but I enjoy the creative mecha designs and it's a fun and enjoyable series.  Plus it's a landmark entry in the franchise.  It was the first series to feature multiple Gundams, the first to be set in an AU outside of the Universal Century timeline, and the first series to feature a mid-season upgrade for the main character which would become a mainstay of the franchise.

Least favorite, Gundam 00.  The overuse of the Minovsky Physics trope to justify everything that happens gets really ridiculous at times.  Also, the overly pretentious protagonist centered morality really gets under my skin.",True,False,False,Gundam,t5_2sjr4,78900,public,self,,,Most and least favorite Gundam series.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/hfgvqa/most_and_least_favorite_gundam_series/,,all_ads,6,discussion,83f4319a-5fa5-11e7-8e79-0ec8348f5b38,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
